<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> makes programming fun again. The learning curve is a blessing.
It make you pay attention not only to what you do but why you do it that way. 
If computers are <quote>"Bicycles for the Mind (Steve Jobs)"</quote> then surely Rust must be the "Chain gear" that propels your realizations.

<h2 id="Js-Py_ffi">Boost JavaScript &amp; Python</h2>
<img class="autofit" src="./pix/Python_JavaScript_logo.svg" />

If you've been coding in Python or Javascript for a while, chances are your have encountered situations
where speed and efficiency became an issue. Speeding things with C or C++ may have seamed a good solution but it opened a whole other can of problems.
Suddenly you may have found yourself spending time being a internal memory troubleshooter and a python or javascript developer.

Rust is the secret weapon that will bring back sanity to your projects. 
With Rust you can <b>safely</b> <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2016/10/19/fixing-python-performance-with-rust" target="_bank">Boost Python</a> or [Speed-up Javascript-NodeJs]()

Let's do that together!

<h2 id="wasm_prog">Rust and Webassembly</h2>

Code once, run anywhere! ... Again! ... and for Real!

Whether you want to build an entire application for the browser or even out of the borwser but in compiled to webassembly
or you want to build a part of an application in webassembly, Rust code can be compile into WebAssembly (wasm) and the rust 
eco-sysment makes it easy to do so.

### Non-Tech Texts, Ideas and Concept

If you enjoy word play and constrained metaphors 
and prose posing as poems, there are more 
<a href="./writings/index.html"> in this section</a>

Bearing in mind that:


"Ideas are like, not the work!"  
    _ Cameron Howe : halt and catch fire, s4e9  


When you are done with the art and fun of word play and concept twisting,
or if you wish to view technical or IT oriented text, you may wish to proceed 
to the <a href="#process">next section *Tech Contepts Lab* .</a>

<div class="sponsor purple" id="process">
### Tech Contepts Lab


<img class="autofit" src="./pix/flasks.svg" />

To really understand something, one first learn the rules and become good at it.   
To master something, one needs to experiment with the constraints, twist, bend 
and sometimes break the rules.   

The Tech Concept Lab is such a place.

Going against the general concensus and status quo on select Computer Science,
Software Enginering, Software Development habits, processes and cult like practices.

Let's start with the wise practice of <a href="writings/sect.html">TDD, BDD, ...</a>

Here is how I earn my `DOUGH`. Its all about `PASTA`.

- `P` ractice  
- `A` dapt (for your constraints)  
- `S` tudy (senior's code)  
- `T` week (optimize)  
- `A` buse (push it to the limit)  

If you enjoy playful mnemonics and applicable bullet list in the context of Software Development, 
there's more in this section

- Code as a Narrative

If you are eager for tutorial, code-alongs, and code walkthrough head-on to the next section.

### Code Walkthrough and Tutorials

Practice your SPEED.  Its not what you think. You don't have to become a keyboard touchtyping wizard.
SPEED are a set of *`S`*orted *`P`*rogramming *`E`*xamples and *`E`*xercise *`D`*rills.
