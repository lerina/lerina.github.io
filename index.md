`Software Development` happens way before any line of code is hatched.
Whether one is a software engineer, a web developer or an old school hacker the core principles remains the same;

- Clarity and Understanding through openness and adventure.
- Creativity in Coding      through concise explicitness and structure. 
- Agency by Delivery        through swiftness and collaborative infrastructure.

**Creativity in Coding**

This section is about Writing Software. 
You will find Writings about the Charge and Craft of Software production.
And tips, tutorials, and code along lessons.

- Prog as a story

- Narration as a teaching tool in programming

- current interests {rust, wasm, Js, Py, Dj} 


Methodology

> Code Step through

> Code Walk through

> Speed Coding (Sorted Examples & Exercise Drills)

#### This is the Processing Stage

Code implementation is interlaced between alternating cycles 
of Solution Development and Software Design.
