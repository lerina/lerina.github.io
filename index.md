Rust makes programming fun again. The learning curve is a blessing.
It make you pay attention not only to what you do but why you do it that way.

[Start here `Rust Download`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and come back to learn by read and type code, old style.

### Non-Tech Texts, Ideas and Concept


"I am the Maker of my     `PEACE`  
 I am the Tamer of my     `Passions`  
 I am the Tutor of my     `Emotions`  
 I am the Deflator of my  `Anger`  
 I am the Moderator of my `Cravings`  
 I am the Regulator of my `Energy` "  
                                                _ lerina  


If you enjoy word play and constrained metaphors 
and prose posing as poems, there are more

Bearing in mind that:


"Ideas are like, not the work!"  
    _ Cameron Howe : halt and catch fire, s4e9  


When you are done with the art and fun of word play and concept twisting,
or if you wish to view technical or IT oriented text, you may wish to proceed 
to the <a href="#process">next section *Tech Contepts Lab* .</a>

### Tech Contepts Lab

To really understand something, one first learn the rules and become good at it.   
To master something, one needs to experiment with the constraints, twist, bend 
and sometimes break the rules.   

The Tech Concept Lab is such a place.

<img class="autofit" src="./pix/02_id_and_patterns.svg" />

Going against the general concensus and status quo on select Computer Science,
Software Enginering, Software Development habits, processes and cult like practices.

TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels. 
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to let SECT prevail.

- `S` tory Driven Requirements
- `E` xample Driven Design
- `C` ode Driven Development
- `T` est Driven Delivery

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code 
that matter.

Not every progress is about rebelion. Its less about seeking controversy and
more about optimizing for efficiency.


"From spaghetti code to ravioli code:   
 self-contained modules with value inside"  
                                 __ lerina  

Here is how I earn my `DOUGH`. Its all about `PASTA`.

- `P` ractice  
- `A` dapt (for your constraints)  
- `S` tudy (senior's code)  
- `T` week (optimize)  
- `A` buse (push it to the limit)  

If you enjoy playful mnemonics and applicable bullet list in the context of Software Development, 
there's more in this section

## Code as a Narrative

Code listings and Tracing code used to be the only way to learn programming back in the days.
It left me with a longing for something similar in the durrent wonderful of git and other publically browsable code repositories.
But short of painstakinly going from commit to comit until the Head, how can we get the same sense of code discovery?

I've been playing with the concept of `code as a narrative` recently. The notion is not new.
It has had various definition and partial implementation.  
From [Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming),  [literateprogramming.com](http://www.literateprogramming.com/), [Donald Knuth - Literate programming - youTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkXg2LZIMQ)  
to [Pseudocode Programming Process](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/code-complete-second/0735619670/ch09.html)  
to [Code That Reads Like a Story](https://lightsonsoftware.com/writing-code-that-reads-like-a-story/)  

The particular version emerging from this Tech Lab is `Code as a Narrative`. 
I find it very useful as a teaching tool. But I'm not fixed yet as its value in 
a professional project. Thats why is still in the Tech Lab Section

If you are eager for tutorial, code-alongs, and code walkthrough head-on to the next section.
