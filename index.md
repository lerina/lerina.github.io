*Rust: Speed and Power without compromising Safety.*

After 40 years of *more of the same*, finally a computer language that is neither a toy, 
nor an academic proof of concept.

<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> makes programming fun again. 
The learning curve is a blessing.
It make you pay attention not only to what you do but why you do it that way.  
 
If computers are <quote>"Bicycles for the Mind (Steve Jobs)"</quote>   
then surely *Rust must be the "Chain gear" that propels sane realizations*.

<h2 id="Js-Py_ffi">Boost JavaScript &amp; Python</h2>
<img class="autofit" src="./pix/Python_JavaScript_logo.svg" />

If you've been coding in Python or Javascript for a while, chances are your have 
encountered situations where speed and efficiency became an issue. 
Speeding things with C or C++ may have seamed a good solution but it opened 
a whole other can of problems.
Suddenly you may have found yourself spending time being a internal memory 
troubleshooter and a python or javascript developer.

Rust is the secret weapon that will bring back sanity to your projects. 
With Rust you can <b>safely</b> <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2016/10/19/fixing-python-performance-with-rust" target="_bank">Boost Python</a> or [Speed-up Javascript-NodeJs]()

<h2 id="wasm_prog">Rust and Webassembly</h2>
<img class="autofit" src="./pix/Web_Assembly_Logo.svg" />

Code once, run anywhere! ... Again! ... and for Real!

Webassembly (Wasm) is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages 
such as Rust.  

Enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications 
or offline with 
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" target="_blank">WASI</a> *the WebAssembly System Interface*

Rust code can be compile into WebAssembly (wasm) 
and the rust eco-system 
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm" target="_blank">*Modern amenities*</a> makes it easy to do so.

### Non-Tech Texts, Ideas and Concept

<img class="autofit" src="./pix/peace.svg" />

Software Writing (a.k.a programming) is a mind game. One's state of mind and the ability to 
have clarity, focus and persistance are often unmentioned essentials skills of the craft.
 
If you enjoy more word play, constrained metaphors and prose posing as poems, 
dealing with such topics you'll find more 
<a href="./writings/index.html"> in the Selected Writings section</a>

<em>
Bearing in mind that:


"Ideas are like, not the work!"  
    _ Cameron Howe : halt and catch fire, s4e9  


When you are done with the art and fun of word play and concept twisting,
or if you wish to view technical or IT oriented text, you may wish to proceed 
to the <a href="#process">next section *Tech Contepts Lab* .</a>

<div class="sponsor purple" id="process">
### Tech Contepts Lab


<img class="autofit" src="./pix/flasks.svg" />

To understand something, first learn the rules and become good at it.
To master something, experiment with the constraints, bend and sometimes 
break the rules.

The Tech Concept Lab is a safe place to deliberatly challenge general concensus 
on select Computer Science, Software Enginering, Software Development habits. 

If you enjoy playful mnemonics, actionable bullet list in the context 
of Software Development or poking fun at processes and cult like practices 
then there's more in this section too.

If you are eager for tutorial, learning-by-doing, code-alongs, and code walkthrough head-on 
to the <a href="./index.html#output">next section</a>.

### Code Walkthrough and Tutorials

<img class="autofit" src="./pix/speed-practice.svg" />

Practice your SPEED.
Its not what you think. You don't have to become a keyboard touch typing wizard.

SPEED are a set of *`S`*orted *`P`*rogramming *`E`*xamples and *`E`*xercise *`D`*rills.

Besides tutorials, there are numerous code walkthroughs in Rust but also Python and JavaScript
to re-enforce  familiarity with reading and analysing code and the coder's intent.

We adopted a **Retro *code listing* ** type of methodology to cultivate learning my mimicing, then doing solo, 
then experimenting.

Speaking of Retro, if you enjoy retro games and the limitless power of imagination, 
head-on to the Learning Rust Role Playing Game or <a href="./index.html#tRPG">theRustProgrammingGame</a> for short.
