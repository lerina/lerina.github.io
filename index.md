Hello, Friend! I am Lerina. I've been experimenting with different ways to ease the first contact with the Rust Programming Language,
and I believe [<img src="./pix/learning_rust_rpg_16x16.png" align="bottom" />RPG](/rrpg/) The Learning Rust Role Playing Game is a fine addition to 
the various tutorial available to date.

## What is `The` Learning Rust `RPG`? 
It's an Game designed for _programmer_ of all level to ease and foster the process of getting confortable with Rust.
The end goal is to encourage the player to become a contributor to the Rust Community.


## A Game for Programmers by Programmers

The most productive way to learn a programming language is to code.
in Rust and ship stuff (programs, apps, webassembly,...)
is to learn by doing and having fun learning.

You're going to solve challenges, script solutions, code programs, build applications and have fun doing it
as you progress though the narrative and surmount challenges

Although the process of creating programs and solving problems using a computer, will
be usefull in your gaming experience, this is not a Computer science tutorial or class.
There are enough quality classes and tutorials on the web, someof which are linked in the resources area.

This game does assume some prior programming knowledge however familiarity with Rust will naturally increase as the player 
advances though the game.

[You've heard about Rust](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/os-developers-know-rust/)
Perhaps you've started [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) the excellent Official Rust book. If so, thats perfect
the 

Rust is a pleasure to work with once you get over certain challenges that stem from the need to write good, safe code.


When you program, or code, you provide instructions for the computer to follow. However in this RPG the roles are flipped.
The system will provide instructions, tutorial, assignments and learning challenges, in order for you to be able
to  program, or code solutions and tests XXX to move the story forward XXX.


Learn the Rust Programming Language through a teaching Role Playing Game.

a good foundation for understanding how to get the most out of the Rust language and development ecosystem.

To start, you don't have to register or join a club, this is free as

[<img src="./pix/learning_rust_rpg_16x16.png" align="bottom" />RPG](/rrpg/) is a single-player Game.
Players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. 
Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, 
either through literal acting xxxxx or through a process of structured decision-making of character development.
Actions taken within the game succeed or fail according to the players real accomplishements and the flow dictated by a formal system of rules and guidelines.
