<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> makes programming fun again. The learning curve is a blessing.
It make you pay attention not only to what you do but why you do it that way. 
If computers are <quote>"Bicycles for the Mind (Steve Jobs)"</quote> then surely Rust must be the "Chain gear" that propels your realizations.

<img class="autofit" src="./pix/Python_JavaScript_logo.svg" />

If you've been coding in Python or Javascript for a while, chances are your have encountered situations
where speed and efficiency became an issue. Speeding things with C or C++ may have seamed a good solution but it opened a whole other can of problems.
Suddenly you may have found yourself spending time being a internal memory troubleshooter and a python or javascript developer.

Rust is the secret weapon that will bring back sanity to your projects. 
With Rust you can <b>safely</b> <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2016/10/19/fixing-python-performance-with-rust" target="_bank">Boost Python</a> or [Speed-up Javascript-NodeJs]()

Let's do that together!

Code once, run anywhere! ... Again! ... and for Real!

Whether you want to build an entire application for the browser or even out of the borwser but in compiled to webassembly
or you want to build a part of an application in webassembly, Rust code can be compile into WebAssembly (wasm) and the rust 
eco-sysment makes it easy to do so.

If you enjoy word play and constrained metaphors 
and prose posing as poems, there are more 
<a href="./writings/index.html"> in this section</a>

Bearing in mind that:


"Ideas are like, not the work!"  
    _ Cameron Howe : halt and catch fire, s4e9  


When you are done with the art and fun of word play and concept twisting,
or if you wish to view technical or IT oriented text, you may wish to proceed 
to the <a href="#process">next section *Tech Contepts Lab* .</a>

### Tech Contepts Lab


<img class="autofit" src="./pix/flasks.svg" />

To really understand something, one first learn the rules and become good at it.   
To master something, one needs to experiment with the constraints, twist, bend 
and sometimes break the rules.   

The Tech Concept Lab is such a place.

Going against the general concensus and status quo on select Computer Science,
Software Enginering, Software Development habits, processes and cult like practices.

TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels. 
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to stand by the SECT:

- `S` tory Driven Requirements
- `E` xample Driven Design
- `C` ode Driven Development
- `T` est Driven Delivery

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code 
that matter.

Not every progress is about rebelion. Its less about seeking controversy and
more about optimizing for efficiency.

 self-contained modules with value inside"

Here is how I earn my `DOUGH`. Its all about `PASTA`.

- `P` ractice  
- `A` dapt (for your constraints)  
- `S` tudy (senior's code)  
- `T` week (optimize)  
- `A` buse (push it to the limit)  

If you enjoy playful mnemonics and applicable bullet list in the context of Software Development, 
there's more in this section

## Code as a Narrative

Code listings and Tracing code used to be the only way to learn programming back in the days.
It left me with a longing for something similar in the durrent wonderful of git and other publically browsable code repositories.
But short of painstakinly going from commit to comit until the Head, how can we get the same sense of code discovery?

I've been playing with the concept of `code as a narrative` recently. The notion is not new.
It has had various definition and partial implementation.  
From [Literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming),  [literateprogramming.com](http://www.literateprogramming.com/), [Donald Knuth - Literate programming - youTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkXg2LZIMQ)  
to [Pseudocode Programming Process](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/code-complete-second/0735619670/ch09.html)  
to [Code That Reads Like a Story](https://lightsonsoftware.com/writing-code-that-reads-like-a-story/)  

The particular version emerging from this Tech Lab is `Code as a Narrative`. 
I find it very useful as a teaching tool. But I'm not fixed yet as its value in 
a professional project. Thats why is still in the Tech Lab Section

If you are eager for tutorial, code-alongs, and code walkthrough head-on to the next section.
