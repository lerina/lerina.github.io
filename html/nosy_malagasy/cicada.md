The cultural core of the Malagasy is a package consisting of 
- the language
- reverence for the Razana and Razan'be
- outer respect for elders
- inner respect for teachers
- gratitude for deeds one can emulate and the mistakes one can avoid duplicating

---

The Malagasy vaovao extends this with a consistent and deliberate effort to 
- improve the legacy of the sovereign past with contemporary wisdom and assets
- contain the onslaught of contemporary decay with renewed vigorous usage of the Malagasy language 
- update the Malagasy language to be better equipped for the science and economy of the times we live in.

When you try and fail, ... you try, try, again
This time around, we are preparing the teachers, 
and have the "books" ready before even starting to mentor the learners.

Let them confuse our patience for pacifism.

We act in the open. Having no secret, we are without burden.
The secret of no secret is the doubt of their own creation.
Reigniting the core of the Malagasy is enough to burn away all
defilement.
