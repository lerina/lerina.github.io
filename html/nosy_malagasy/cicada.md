The cultural core of the malagasy is a package consisting of 
- the language
- reverance for the Razana and Razan'be
- outer respect for elders
- inner respect for teachers
- gratitude for deeds and the mistakes one can avoid duplicating

---

The Malagasy vaovao extends this with a consistant and deliberate effort to 
- improve the legacy of the soverain past with contemporary wisdom and assets
- contain the onsloght of contemporary decay with renewed vigorous usage of the Malagasy language 
- update the malagasy language to be better equiped for the science and economy of the times we live in.

When you try and fail, ... you try, try, again
This time around, we are preparing the teachers, and have the "books" ready befor even starting to mentor the learners.
