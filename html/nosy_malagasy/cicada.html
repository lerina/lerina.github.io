<p>The cultural core of the Malagasy is a package consisting of - the language - reverence for the Razana and Razan’be - outer respect for elders - inner respect for teachers - gratitude for deeds one can emulate and the mistakes one can avoid duplicating</p>
<hr />
<p>The Malagasy vaovao extends this with a consistent and deliberate effort to - improve the legacy of the sovereign past with contemporary wisdom and assets - contain the onslaught of contemporary decay with renewed vigorous usage of the Malagasy language - update the Malagasy language to be better equipped for the science and economy of the times we live in.</p>
<p>When you try and fail, … you try, try, again This time around, we are preparing the teachers, and have the “books” ready before even starting to mentor the learners.</p>
