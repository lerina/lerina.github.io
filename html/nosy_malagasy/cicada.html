<p>The cultural core of the malagasy is a package consisting of - the language - reverance for the Razana and Razan’be - outer respect for elders - inner respect for teachers - gratitude for deeds and the mistakes one can avoid duplicating</p>
<hr />
<p>The Malagasy vaovao extends this with a consistant and deliberate effort to - improve the legacy of the soverain past with contemporary wisdom and assets - contain the onsloght of contemporary decay with renewed vigorous usage of the Malagasy language - update the malagasy language to be better equiped for the science and economy of the times we live in.</p>
<p>When you try and fail, … you try, try, again This time around, we are preparing the teachers, and have the “books” ready befor even starting to mentor the learners.</p>
