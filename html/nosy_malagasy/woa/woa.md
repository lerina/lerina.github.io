# Ny Antoka
The pledge

<article id="intro">
This pledge is our oral family tradition. 
It is a distiled formulation of the essence 
of the Malagasy way of the ancestors.   

In typical Malagasy wisdom, it builds on the old to absorb
the new. As such it is a fascinating path thru time and space,
a portal into the garden of the origin and transformation of the Malagasy.
In this garden primordial trees coexist with strong old trees and new flowers.
Each season brings its flavor and scent to the forefront, but for those in the background the seeds of renewal already awaits.  
In an endless cycle of the same but different
each generation brings its inspiring wisdom of their days,
and leave cautionary tales of their lives.  
The pledge is not a doctrine, and is immune to dogma.
It allows for contradictions, and promotes an `adapt before you adopt` mindset.  

The pledge then is a guide, a reminder of what is left of a Malagasy when 
the food, the smells, the sounds, the songs, the regional customs and celebrations
are melted away.  What remains of a Malagasy when academic distinction, religious branding and financial division are striped away.

- Commentary

```
Effort is oblivious to desire or ambition.
Mindful awareness does not stumble and falter.
Centered the Now concentrates in the Present.
Thus is polished the power of Focus.
```

**Effort is oblivious to desire or ambition.**  
There are many reasons for doing thing.
But the most "mora mora" (painless, effortless) way
is when your effort does not depend on a reason.
You are not doing it because you fear punishement or failure
You are not doing it because you seek reward or success.
You are doing it be cause YOU decided to do it. 
Because it is what you choose to do at that very moment.

**Mindful awareness does not stumble and falter.**
The tool to apply effortless effort to what you
have decided to do is to be mindful.
Mindfulness is the result of not paying attention to 
unnecessary things. When you temporarly let go 
of distraction and don't give any importance 
to the things that are not the subject of your effort, 
you become very aware of all the things that helps 
you do what you chose to do at that very moment.

**Centered the Now concentrates in the Present**
Mindfulness is hard to maintain. Awareness may not 
stumble and falter but Mindfulness often do.
Distractions of all sorts will keep coming at you. 
Feelings born from desire and ambition will 
always come knocking at your door.
The trick is to exercise your freedom to choose where you 
place your attention. Placing your attention back to 
what you are doing at the moment is a super power.

This ability is something you can train, and becomes easy over time.
You simple ask yourself "Is my attention occupied with what I have 
decided to do?". In Malagasy we use the word Grounded rather than 
centered. Like a tree firmly rooted on its ground, it will bend but it will not move away from its foundation.
Likewise we can suddenly get lost in distractive moods and activities
but the moment we are aware of that, we come back to the subject of a current focus
we bring back mindfulness to what we chose to do.

**Thus is polished the power of Focus.**
The sword of wisdom, the art of disciple, and the power of focus
are the three tools we got from our Austronesian and Indonesian ancestors. 
At the time of their arrival to Nosy Malagasy, they where still Buddhist, just starting to become Hindu. 
When their culture mixed with the Vazimba, and later with the arab, Swahili people, a true Malagasy culture emerged.
