The ability to code mindfully is a super-weapon.

 - Single-tasking: Our industry glorifies multitasking, but it's time to rebel. Focus on one piece of code, one feature, or one bug at a time. As Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh advises in "The Miracle of Mindfulness", concentrate on the task at hand and let go of distractions. Your code - and your mind - will thank you.

- Breaks and breathers: Do not underestimate the power of a pause. Step away from your screen every so often, maybe every 25 minutes (Pomodoro Technique, anyone?). Use this time to take a few deep breaths, stretch, or just enjoy the non-pixelated world for a moment.

- Mindful code review: When reviewing your code or others', take your time. Don't rush to find errors or fixes. Instead, adopt an attitude of curiosity and learning. Every line of code has a story, so listen to it.

- Meditative moments: Consider incorporating formal mindfulness practices, like meditation, into your routine.


Pay attention  
Keep coming back to the task at hand at the Present Moment. 
By consciously allowing your periferal awarness to let go that wish is not releant to the task at hand.
Reduce distractions and improve the time actually spend on coding activities (tests/ context/ ...). 

Avoid Flow State  
Flow state, often referred to as "being in the zone," is a mental state where people experience deep concentration and complete absorption in their activity. It is best suited for physical or manual activities (Sports, carpentry, ...) .
Cultivate difused or peripheral awarness instead. 
Problem Solving is a Creative and systematic activity. 
By staying present and focused, developers can better analyze issues, think critically.

## Mindful Beginnings

Start your coding sessions with a moment of mindfulness.  
Take a few deep breaths, and clear your mind of distractions.  
This sets the stage for a focused coding experience.  

### Staying Present While Coding

It's easy to get lost in thought or distractions while coding.  
Mindfulness reminds you to stay in the present moment.  
When coding, concentrate on the task at hand, and resist the urge to check social media or let your mind wander.

### Mindful Debugging

Debugging can be frustrating, but mindfulness can make it smoother.  
Approach bugs with patience and curiosity, just like solving a puzzle.  
Stay calm and methodical as you track down issues.

### Mindful Code Reviews

When reviewing code, be attentive and constructive.  
Instead of rushing through, take your time to understand the code fully.  
Offer feedback with kindness and a focus on improvement rather than criticism.

### Mindful Breaks

Don't forget to take short mindfulness breaks during your coding day.  
Step away from the computer, take a walk, or practice a brief meditation.  
These breaks recharge your mind and prevent burnout.

### Recollection in Coding

Mindfulness isn't only about staying focused; it's also about appreciating the process.  
Cultivate Recollection of the experience of coding and the skills you're developing.  
This positive outlook can boost your overall well-being.


## The practice

Create a routine by scheduling mindfulness sessions, setting reminders, or incorporating mindfulness into your daily coding rituals.
There are three cumulative levels.

Level 01:  

- Dedicate 10 minutes each day before work for mindfulness practice.
- Before any tasks, clean your work area and browser tabs
- review each steps for the task. The set a time to beat for completion.
- Selected task must be completed on that day, hence keep them very small. 
- Sub-tasks related to the task at hand become the task that must be completed and the parent task is automatically deselected.

Level 02:

- Dedicate 20 minutes each day before work for mindfulness practice.
- Dedicate just a few minutes before each user-story to drop into mindfulness.
- Mindfulness requires stillness. Practice mindful coding. Slow down to go faster. Do less to achieve more.
- Practice using your tools (editor, git, ...)
- Practice the fundamentals to become second nature (ex: File IO in code, API CRUD, ...)

Level03:

- Dedicate 40 minutes each day before work for mindfulness practice.
- Start each coding session with a few minutes of sitting meditation.
- End each session with a few minutes of walking meditation.
- Take three deep breaths before and after each Git commit and Git push.
- Rest when you're tired, eat when you're hungry, drink when you're thirsty, but not while coding
