## Progression


We track three things:
- Time spent on  Deep work.
- Commitment and consistency.
- Real tangible results

Xp represents the number of *Skcor* completed in a period of 5 days.
The time spent on deep focused tasks is called *Skcor*. A *Skcor* is a chunk or 
block of 20 minutes. Why *Skcor*? Because *Skcor* **rockS**!

Hp tracks your consistency streak. Every 5 days without breaking the chain, 
you add the total of Skcor to the Xp and increment the Hp by 1. You then 
reset the Xp and start tracking *Skcor* for another 5 days.

Optionaly, since Hp are incremented 1 by 1, you can use the space to also note 
the week number (or group of 5 days) and the total *Skcor* for that week. 
This gives use a opportunity to also track the progress of our ability 
to perform deep work.

Lv tracks your accomplishements. Actual non trivial work completed such as projects and certifications ... Lv is incremented each time a "real" project with "real" consequences to your life is completed. Impactful stuff such as:

- getting a drivers licence
- publishing a paper
- create and manage an Open Source project
- Completing and online course
...
