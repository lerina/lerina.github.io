## Tips for writing the story arc

The Kishotenketsu (from qichengzhuanhe), a storytelling structure, can actually correspond to the Dan Harmon Story Circle.

Ki (Introduction):
1. You
2. Need

Sho (Development):
3. Go
4. Search

Ten (Twist):
5. Find
6. Take

Ketsu (Conclusion):
7. Return
8. Change

In a story, the following might happen:

    Introduction (ki): an introduction to the characters, era, and other information required to understand the plot.
    Development (shō): follows leads towards the twist in the story. No major changes so far.
    Twist (ten): the story turns toward an unexpected development. This is the crux of the story, the yama (ヤマ) or climax. If the narrative takes several turns, this is the biggest one.
    Conclusion (ketsu), also called ochi (落ち) or ending, wraps up the story.
