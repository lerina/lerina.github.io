<p>Everything above could be seen as a productiv Everything above could be seen as a productivity tool and story telling engine. Real life actions are mapped to in game scenes.</p>
<p>The real gaming begins if you add Twists and turns in the unfolding of the story. That is the story can take different directions without real life input, thus altering the dynamics of the game. The real life accompleshements become even more crutial, because you need all the points you can get since you never know what unpredictable mayhem the game can throw at the PIC (Player In Character).</p>
<h3 id="binary-ish-questions">Binary (ish) questions</h3>
<p>Actions in the Scenes can be further enriched with dynamic ingame narratives. You ask a closed ended question and roll 1D6 and craft the answer.</p>
<pre><code>Answer          Do you get what you want?                                   Harm
--------------  ---------------------------------------------------         -----------
Yes, and...     You get what you want, and something else.                  Cause 3
Yes...          You get what you want.                                      Cause 2
Yes, but...     You get what you want, but at a cost.                       Cause 1
No, but...      You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss.     Take 1
No...           You don’t get what you were after.                          Take 2
No, and...      You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.          Take 3</code></pre>
<h3 id="doubles-and-the-twist-counter">DOUBLES AND THE TWIST COUNTER</h3>
<p>If you roll twice the same number consecutively, you get to alter the narrative itself.</p>
<pre><code>D6          Subject                             Action

3           An encounter                        Helps the hero
4           A physical event                    Hinders the hero
5           An emotional event                  Changers the goal
