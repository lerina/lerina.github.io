[from the documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen_futures/){target="_blank"}:  

"*Converting between JavaScript Promises to Rust Futures.*

*This crate provides a bridge for working with JavaScript Promise types as a Rust Future,*   
*and similarly contains utilities to turn a rust Future into a JavaScript Promise.* 
*This can be useful when working with asynchronous or otherwise blocking work in Rust (wasm),* 
*and provides the ability to interoperate with JavaScript events and JavaScript I/O primitives.*"
