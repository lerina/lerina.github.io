<p>Get into the habit of Iterative, incremental software development
with <!-- Feedback informed Test/Code --> <strong>F</strong>eedback
<strong>i</strong>nformed
<strong>T</strong>est/<strong>C</strong>ode</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First feedback: From Requirement to test<br />
Can the developer write a test for the selected requirement? If not
requirements are not clear and/or understood. What is the behavioral
intent?</p></li>
<li><p>Second feedback: Failing test first<br />
Is the failing test succint? Have you encoded the behavioral expectation
within your assertion. Does the error indicate the most proximate
missing feature?</p></li>
<li><p>Third feedback: Code Interface<br />
Can the test easily use the code? Testable code is a must. Take some
time to think of function signature and design of the interface to the
code.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth feedback: The right code works write<br />
Does the test pass? The code that makes a test pass is a response to a
particular requirement. YAGNI is built-in. It does the job and thats
all.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth feedback: DRY, SOLID, put best practices acronyms
here<br />
Is it time for a refactor session? FiT code is readable, clean,
lean.</p></li>

<h3 id="from-requirement-to-test">From Requirement to test</h3>
<p>The answers to the “blank page”; Where to start? You start with the
requirements. Select a requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can the developer write a test for the selected requirement?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If not requirements are not clear and/or understood. What is the
behavioral intent? Understanding the requirements is the responsability
of the developer. What do we want? What do we have? How do we go from
what we have to what we want.</p>
<p>Invest time in data design, domain design, and the interaction
between entities.</p>
<h3 id="failing-test-first">Failing test first</h3>
<p>Is the failing test succint? Have you encoded the behavioral
expectation within your assertion. Does the error indicate the most
proximate missing feature?</p>
<p>Focus is shifted to how can I test this rather than how can I write
this.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Read more than you write:</p></li>
<li><p>When reading code, it’s not crucial to understand the whole
project or the ins and outs of the entire design. Read the code. Look at
the comments, see what the authors are doing, and how they went about
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop an aesthetic appreciation for code. Read the source code
of famous open-source tools and frameworks. Train yourself to know what
great code looks like and what bad code “smells” like.</p></li>
<li><p>Get used to Basic TDD</p></li>
<li><p>Guidelines for names</p></li>
<li><p>Functions/Method – Say what it does. What is the outcome? Why
would I call this?</p></li>
<li><p>Variable – Say what it contains. Why would I access
this?</p></li>
</ul>
