<h1 id="expertise-and-discipline">Expertise and Discipline</h1>
<h2 id="discipline">Discipline</h2>
<p>There’s one essential ingredient in the process of creating change that too often gets overlooked: discipline. Beyond the desire to do something and the motivation to get started, there is a need to put in the work—repeatedly, consistently, and enduringly.</p>
<p>Discipline is what kicks in long after motivation has faded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Endure</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</em> ~ MARCUS AURELIUS</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove temptations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I can resist anything except temptation.”</em> ~ OSCAR WILDE</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set clear goals and have an execution plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice daily diligence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We aren’t born with self-discipline; it’s a learned behavior. And just like any other skill you want to master, it requires daily practice and repetition. It must become habitual.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practice delayed gratification</p></li>
<li><p>Practice Sensual restraint &amp; emosameness</p></li>
<li><p>Forgive yourself and move forward.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn from your missteps, then get your head back in the game.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-expert">What does it mean to be an expert?</h2>
<p>An expert is someone who achieves exceptionally high performance levels on a particular task or within a specific subject matter. They are also typically one of the most informed people in their field and achieve far beyond what the average person does. Some of the critical elements of expertise include</p>
<ul>
<li>skills,</li>
<li>advanced and in-depth knowledge, and</li>
<li>proof of achievement such as recognition or awards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you can become a master in a particular subject, skill or activity is only something you can determine after you try.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice, where you practice things outside of your comfort zone and move beyond your current skill level, is necessary for improving your skills. When most people practice, they focus on the things they already know how to do. Deliberate practice is different. It entails considerable, specific, and sustained efforts to do something you can’t do well—or even at all. Research across domains shows that it is only by working at what you can’t do that you turn into the expert you want to become.</p>
<p>Practice as much as you feel you can accomplish with concentration. Max four or five hours of high concentration and deliberate practice at a time.</p>
<p>Think about what you could accomplish if you devoted two hours a day to deliberate practice.</p>
<p>Moving outside your traditional comfort zone of achievement requires substantial motivation and sacrifice, but it’s a necessary discipline.</p>
<p>Take the Time You Need. Many people are naive about how long it takes to become an expert. Overnight success are 10 years in the making spent on training and preparation.</p>
<p>Not only do you have to be prepared to invest time in becoming an expert, but you have to start early—at least in some fields. Your ability to attain expert performance is clearly constrained if you have fewer opportunities to engage in deliberate practice, and this is far from a trivial constraint.</p>
<h3 id="self-feedback">Self-feedback</h3>
<p>In the absence of mentors, and coaches, Study something you value, then try to reproduce it. Then compare with the original and learn, correct, then try again.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin provides one of the best examples of motivated self-coaching. When he wanted to learn to write eloquently and persuasively, he began to study his favorite articles from a popular British publication, the Spectator. Days after he’d read an article he particularly enjoyed, he would try to reconstruct it from memory in his own words. Then he would compare it with the original, so he could discover and correct his faults. He also worked to improve his sense of language by translating the articles into rhyming verse and then from verse back into prose. Similarly, famous painters sometimes attempt to reproduce the paintings of other masters.</p>
<p>Take these steps to gain expertise in a specific field:</p>
<pre><code>Identify what you&#39;re interested in.

Focus on one task at a time.

Start with what&#39;s most important.

Invest time and effort.

Set specific goals.

Engage in deliberate practice.

Find or create an environment for practice.

Look for specific and accurate feedback.

Find a mentor.

Test yourself often.

Focus on progression.</code></pre>
<h3 id="components-of-expertise">Components of Expertise</h3>
<p>Knowledge, skill, and achievement are all critical components of expertise. People who become experts tend to acquire a body of knowledge that makes them one of the most informed individuals in their field.</p>
<p>They also possess the skills that they need to determine when and how to use their knowledge. Such skills are often learned, but they can also be influenced by natural talent and ability.</p>
<p>Finally, people who possess expertise also tend to achieve far above and beyond what the average person does. They not only possess knowledge and skill; they also put their talents and know-how to work.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-gain-expertise">How to Gain Expertise</h3>
<p>If you have set an expertise goal. you will need to follow several steps to achieve it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a Commitment: Put in the quality time</li>
<li>Practice Deliberately: Practice thehard stuff. Persevere, stick with it.</li>
<li>Match Practice With Subject Area: Practice the important stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice may play a greater role in improving performance for activities such as music, athletics, and games, and less of a role for professional or educational performance.</p>
<p>So Challenge Yourself</p>
<p>Practice is essential for developing a skill, but becoming an expert requires constantly challenging yourself to do better, learn more, and acquire new knowledge and skills. Rehearsing the same skills over and over again will make you better in those areas, but it won’t lead to true expertise. Teach it. Apply it. Learn From Mistakes</p>
<p>Mistakes are a form of feedback. They tell us not only what not to do, but also what we might try instead. Experts are able to spot these mistakes, correct course, and apply this knowledge in the future.</p>
