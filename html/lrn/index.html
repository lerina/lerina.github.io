<h2 id="hi">Hi,</h2>
<p>I’m Lerina, a software developer based in Waterloo ON, Canada<br/>
but you can sometimes find me in Paris (France) or Antananarivo
(Madagascar).</p>
<p>I currently only take work involving Rust and/or webassembly
(wasm).<br />
These projects usualy happen within the context of a partial update or
maintenance of some Python, Javascript/Ts, or C codebase .</p>
<p>There are a lot of projects out there that are useful and deserve to
ascend to the next level.</p>
<p>This leveling-up often focus on Safer libraries, Faster modules,
Leaner dependencies.</p>
<p>Oxidize: Why</p>
<p>Replace sensible modules with Rust and/or wasm drop-in
replacements.</p>
<p>significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and
other attacks.</p>
<p>Rust is a systems language that provides memory safety without
garbage collection, and concurrency without race conditions <a

here …</a></p>
<p>Handpicked open source projects I’ve worked on.</p>

<h2 id="crazy-goal-smart-goals">Crazy <em>goal</em> &gt; Smart
<em>goal’s</em></h2>
<p>We’ve all heard of SMART the an acronym used for creating Specific
Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-based goals. It doesn’t say
anything about execution.</p>
<p>CRAZY goal is the next step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>C</code> ontrained in time and space [At the correct place,
within the right time] <code>R</code> elevant and robust [meaningful and
worth your total commitment] <code>A</code> ccountable process actions
[chunks are either done or not. No excuses.] <code>Z</code> oom out,
zoom in: Zap it! [Top-down design, bottom-up implementation: Beat your
best time.] <code>Y</code> ield early, reap frequently [feedback
loop]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice its GOAL, not goals. Pick one goal and make sure its
CRAZY.</p>
<h3 id="c-ontrained-in-time-and-space"><code>C</code> ontrained in time
and space</h3>
<p>Schedule the <em>lifeline</em>. Number of time-bubbles to work on
it.</p>
<h3 id="r-elevant-and-robust"><code>R</code> elevant and robust</h3>
<p>(non-frivoulus and impactful)</p>
<h3 id="a-ccountable-process-actions"><code>A</code> ccountable process
actions</h3>
<p>top-down view, bottom-up execution</p>
<h3 id="z-oom-out-zoom-in-zap-it"><code>Z</code> oom out, zoom in: Zap
it!</h3>
<p>see the context, the why, the big picture Dive into the task, one
sub-task at a time</p>
<h3 id="y-ield-early-reap-frequently"><code>Y</code> ield early, reap
frequently</h3>
<p>Measure progress by keeping count of the time-bubbles dedicated to
the process of sub-task completion.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Progress is a process:<br />
While one Plans progress with goals, one Makes progress with
processes.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Technical: Rust, C, Python, Javascript, Node, Deno<br />
