<h2 id="hi">Hi,</h2>
<p>I’m Lerina, a software developer based in Waterloo ON, Canada but you
can sometimes find me in Paris (France) or Antananarivo
(Madagascar).</p>
<p>I currently work (as a preference) primarily in Rust.</p>
<p>Safer Faster Leaner</p>
<p>an open-source maintainer and Rust consultant at corrode, helping
clients make their Rust code faster and more idiomatic. I maintain
analysis-tools.dev, an open platform for static code analysis tools and
Idiomatic Rust. Previously, I ran Hello, Rust!, a YouTube channel about
the Rust programming language</p>
<h2 id="world">world</h2>

<li>willing to take responsibility for ensuring that what you build
delights customers and achieves the goals of the team and the
organization.</li>
<li>Wish to work with talented peers by submitting and reviewing pull
requests, engaging in design discussions, and teaming up to tackle new

<p>significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and
other attacks.</p>
<h2 id="world2">world2</h2>
<p>producing consistent and reliable code and ensuring a safe and secure
operating environment with the systems and software they create.
Additionally, they’ll need to be able to debug, test, and analyze
current and previous iterations of software to resolve issues.</p>
<p>experience with languages like C++, Node.js., React, and more.
Possessing great attention to detail and strong analytical skills will
set a candidate apart.</p>
<p>🚀 I consistently clear obstacles. If something is broken or lacking,
I dive in to investigate, file a thorough ticket, and most of the time
fix or implement the feature myself (see example issue and PR), and if
what I need doesn’t exist yet, I will build it.</p>
<p>🐞 I love the thrill of the chase of debugging. This has led me to
diagnose and address subtle and elusive bugs in all manner of
previously-unfamiliar, complex, and diverse projects (see below), and
all have been tremendous learning opportunities.</p>
<p>⚡ My thrill for debugging has allowed me to develop an acute ability
to dive deep into unfamiliar projects and quickly make meaningful
contributions (see below).</p>

<h2 id="position-trends">Position trends</h2>
<p>The Rust programming language is relatively new, yet it is becoming
one of the hottest programming languages. Top Rust developers are
working on Rustacean Principles in order to keep Rust moving forward as
the best method to do safe, fast, and easy software development. The
principles will function as robust guides to Rust’s long-term
development.</p>
<p>Because Rust is considered better and safer than C and C++, the
future for Rust looks bright. It’s fast and universal, and you can use
it to build a wide variety of applications for different platforms. Rust
stands out compared to other increasingly popular languages such as Ruby
and Python, another reason its star is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>There appears to be no end to how Rust can be adopted as it is being
considered in various challenging environments, including Linux drivers
and the Android project with the aim of improving security.</p>
<h2 id="sample-interview-questions">Sample interview questions</h2>
<p>Can you explain Rust? What are the advantages of using Rust? How does
Rust’s garbage collection work? How do you get a command line argument
in Rust? What are some main features of Rust? Does Rust include move
constructors? How would you write and run a Rust program? What string
type would you use with Rust? Why is Rust a safer option compared to C
and C++? How do you use Rust’s reusable codes? How would you efficiently
input a user read file in Rust? Rust syntax is similar to which
programming language? Can you list the platforms supported by Rust? How
do you install Rust? How do you uninstall Rust? What is Cargo? How do
you debug Rust programs? Can Rust be used for Android/iOS programming?
How do you do dynamic Rust library loading?</p>
<h2 id="crazy-goal-smart-goals">Crazy <em>goal</em> &gt; Smart
<em>goal’s</em></h2>
<p>We’ve all heard of SMART the an acronym used for creating Specific
Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-based goals. It doesn’t say
anything about execution.</p>
<p>CRAZY goal is the next step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>C</code> ontrained in time and space [At the correct place,
within the right time] <code>R</code> elevant and robust [meaningful and
worth your total commitment] <code>A</code> ccountable process actions
[chunks are either done or not. No excuses.] <code>Z</code> oom out,
zoom in: Zap it! [Top-down design, bottom-up implementation: Beat your
best time.] <code>Y</code> ield early, reap frequently [feedback
loop]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice its GOAL, not goals. Pick one goal and make sure its
CRAZY.</p>
<h3 id="c-ontrained-in-time-and-space"><code>C</code> ontrained in time
and space</h3>
<p>Schedule the <em>lifeline</em>. Number of time-bubbles to work on
it.</p>
<h3 id="r-elevant-and-robust"><code>R</code> elevant and robust</h3>
<p>(non-frivoulus and impactful)</p>
<h3 id="a-ccountable-process-actions"><code>A</code> ccountable process
actions</h3>
<p>top-down view, bottom-up execution</p>
<h3 id="z-oom-out-zoom-in-zap-it"><code>Z</code> oom out, zoom in: Zap
it!</h3>
<p>see the context, the why, the big picture Dive into the task, one
sub-task at a time</p>
<h3 id="y-ield-early-reap-frequently"><code>Y</code> ield early, reap
frequently</h3>
<p>Measure progress by keeping count of the time-bubbles dedicated to
the process of sub-task completion.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Progress is a process:<br />
While one Plans progress with goals, one Makes progress with
processes.</p>
