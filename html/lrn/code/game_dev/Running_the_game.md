Everything above could be seen as a productivity tool and story telling engine.
Real life actions are mapped to in game scenes.

The real gaming begins if you add Twists and turns in the unfolding of the story.
That is the story can take different directions without real life input, thus 
altering the dynamics of the game. The real life accompleshements become even more 
crutial, because you need all the points you can get since you never know what
unpredictable mayhem the game can throw at the PIC (Player In Character).

### Binary (ish) questions

Actions in the Scenes can be further enriched with dynamic ingame narratives.
You ask a closed ended question and roll 1D6  and craft the answer.
