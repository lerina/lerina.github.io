## Running the game

Everything above could be seen as a productiv
Everything above could be seen as a productivity tool and story telling engine.
Real life actions are mapped to in game scenes.

The real gaming begins if you add Twists and turns in the unfolding of the story.
That is the story can take different directions without real life input, thus 
altering the dynamics of the game. The real life accompleshements become even more 
crutial, because you need all the points you can get since you never know what
unpredictable mayhem the game can throw at the PIC (Player In Character).

### Binary (ish) questions

Actions in the Scenes can be further enriched with dynamic ingame narratives.
You ask a closed ended question and roll 1D6  and craft the answer.

```
Answer          Do you get what you want?                                   Harm
--------------  ---------------------------------------------------         -----------
Yes, and...     You get what you want, and something else.                  Cause 3
Yes...          You get what you want.                                      Cause 2
Yes, but...     You get what you want, but at a cost.                       Cause 1
No, but...      You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss.     Take 1
No...           You don’t get what you were after.                          Take 2
No, and...      You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.          Take 3
```
### DOUBLES AND THE TWIST COUNTER

If you roll twice the same number consecutively, you get to alter the narrative itself.
  
```
D6          Subject                             Action
1           A 3rd party                         Appears
2           The hero                            Alters the location
3           An encounter                        Helps the hero
4           A physical event                    Hinders the hero
5           An emotional event                  Changers the goal
6           An object                           Ends the scene
```
### DETERMINE THE MOOD OF THE NEXT SCENE

When the next scene is not clear, you can start by setting the mood.

```
D6          Next Scene
1-3         Dramatic Scene
4-5         Quite Scene 
6           Meanwhile
```
