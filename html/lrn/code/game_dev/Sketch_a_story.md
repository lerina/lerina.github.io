## Sketch a story


Using the adventure premise, sketch out a story outline using a version of 
*Harmon's story circle* (eight phases modified for RPG) that goes like this:

1. You     (char_gen/intro)    (a character is in a zone of comfort)
2. Need    (inciting incident) (but they want something)
3. Go      (commitment)        (they enter an unfamiliar situation)
4. Search  (pinch 1)           (and adapt to new situation)
5. Find    (midpoint)          (find what they wanted)
6. Take    (pinch 2)           (and pay the price)
7. Change  (climax)            (now capable of change)
8. Return  (denouement)        (and go back to where they started)

Whichever scene actually resolved the start of the adventure, that’s the climax. 
Having attained their climax in phase 7, that last phase - "Return" - is where 
the PCs travel home (or to wherever their home base is), experience is distributed, 
payment is made, effects are determined, loose ends are tied, and we wind down (as 
a group or solo player), ready for the next session.

Keeping the story circle in mind, we first start with our generated adventure premise, and try to fill in the outline for the first three steps of the circle.

**char in comfort zone**

1. *The PC*: Freelance by day. hacker by night. hustler 24/24
For fn, hustling is not just a skill its an art. It take time to craft, 
practice to perfect, chance to master but thats the thrill of it.
Aside from being able to brush aside past falures and adversity, fn is not 
only one who can get things done, but can make things happen.
fn turns personal pain into steping stones and a chance of progress.
fn also turns others pain into seeds of profitable solutions to apply.

**Need** 

2. *The proposer*: The colonel sits on a park bench, erect like a post as if still on 
active duty. It's been at least one score since he had retired. 
10 years since he picked fn out of the gutter and the dangers of the street. 
7 years since he had given his protegé a new life and identity. 
3 year since the great betreyal, or was it?

3. *The mission*: ... We're talking a risky mission here. Some kind of extraction under extreme duress.

4. *The incentive*: It turns out that the "hostiles" are people fn want revenge on. 
They are the ones that wipped out the last tech-nomads of the old days. 
fn lost family and friends in that desaster. 
This is why the colonel, fn's savior and ex-mentor called this informal meeting. 
Despite the confusion of the past year, the colonel knows, in all things, 
fn is driven in part by the prospect of retaliation.

5. *The target*: Information. Locked away in a secure datacenter. 
The documents are explosive information in the correct hands. 
A game changer.

6. *The seed*: The colonel got the information from an old acquaintance. 
It should be "legit" but *hey!* people can change.

7. *The obstacle*: Space. Vast distance of desert and flat land 
to cross before any hope of reaching the target.

At this point the player accepts the mission. 
We enter the *Go (commitment)* phase and as the PC prepares for the mission, 
the first couple of scenes should make the PC enter an unfamiliar situation
