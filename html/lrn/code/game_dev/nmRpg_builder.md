This is the core of The personal productivity system called `thrust`

## thrust RPG Gamification

We can use this productivity system to power our RPG game.

## [Procedure](./Procedure.html)

## [Create the adventure premise](./Create_adventure_premise.html)

## [Create a character/alter-ego](./Create_a_character.html)

## [Sketch a story](./Sketch_a_story.html)

## Build a Mission: Selecting and designing challenges and activities

Once you have a tentative story outline, it is time to select some real life 
actions, tasks and things to avoid and map it to scenes in our story.
Doing and accomplishing real stuff makes the story go forward.

### 1. Real activities

You make a list of all the tasks you have to do, big or small. 
Don’t filter or organize the items you add to the list, just write it all down 
in a list format.

As stated earlier, there are the 9 Items to take care of for the day.

The PIC (Player in character) and the story progresses scene by scene 
only if your POC (Player Out of Character) progresses in real life by 
completing or performing the 9 specific items for the day.
A real day corresponds to a scene of the character's adventure.

- First you select 3 actions to do for the day.
- Next you select 3 actions **not** to do for the day.
- Finaly you select 3 tasks to complete for the day.


```
renew licence
pay rent
change winter tire

no coffee today
no facebook
no elevators (take the stairs)

read the third chapter of The Rust Programming Language book
do laundry
practice rust code with rustlings
```

### 2. Map activities to Scenes and action play

By maping activities within the game to be in the same spirit as those performed 
by the player in the real life, we get to evolve both the character and the story
as the p[layer actually accomplish real life objectives and targets.

#### Map the story scene to a real life work session or activity

Real life (OC)	    | In the Game (IC)
--------------------|---------------------------
renew licence	    | Get new gear
pay rent	        | Rent a van
appointment to      | meeting with the colonel
change winter tire  |
-                   |-                     
no coffee 	        | succesfully dodge the police
no facebook         | found a spyware tracker
no elevator         | survived a bar fight while trying to upgrade some gears
-   		        | -
read chapter 3 of   | Gather your team
The Rust Programming Language book|
do laundry          | Settled the shares and loot division
practice drills     | Hack into DMV to get new IDs

#### Map story baddees to real life things to avoid

Momentum and consequences regardless of external factors or setbacks.
Progress on growth. 

The big boss of baddees is ... your `inner deceiver`.
The master of self-doubt and self-sabotage.

Subdue the inner deceiver and its five generals


- The JudgeMental
What you did, what you didn't do, what you should have done. The eternal
repetitive negative critic that consumes your internal positivity and replaces it
with out of reach external negativity.
Gets stronger each time you think you are not good enough and lose sight 
of what is within your control.

- The Victimizer
The producer of excuses and drainer of willpower.
Gets stronger each time you give up or stop trying.

- The Misguided Protector
Promotes avoidance by exagerating difficulties to even start.
Fake protection from the risk of failure, judgement or criticism.
Tour "Safe" but Stuck.
Gets stronger each time you are paralized and don't take any action.

- The ringmaster
Productivity guilt. Unhhealthy drive to keep working, pleasing, saying yes.
It is unsustainable and leands to anxiety, crashes, and burnout.
Unfulfilling treadmill of achievement addiction linking your worth as a person 
to how productive you are.
Gets stronger each time you believe you will never be good enough 
or have done enough

- The neglector
Wins then you feel insecure in your worth, anticipate rejection.
Going out of your way to seek approval.
Gets stronger each time you seek validation by prioritizing the needs of everyone else
at your own expense.

The Antidote to deceivers:
Create emotional distance from the deceiver. This make room for more rationality.
This helps shifting into an internal locus of control. How?

Become aware when under attack.

Call it out. Then **choose** not to listen.
write down or go through all the deceivers arguments: 

* Safe and Stuck
    - Is this inside my locus of control? [Y/n]
    - What first step imperfect action can I make *NOW*
* Busy Pleaser
    - Take a break! Is it not what you do but who you are that matters 
    - Are the healthy bounderies up and active?

* Say no
    - Your worth is not linked to how you think other see you.
    - Is your choice an avoidance trap.

Your power:
0. What is is. What was was. acceptance/acknowlegdement of situation as part of life
1. What will be **Restarts** now. You can choose what you focus on at any moment.  selectional attention (focus on things you can change/ on positive things, e.g. name three things you are/were grateful for)
2. You don't make perfection the goal. You make the **process** the goal
3. "is what you are doing helping or harming you?" (control over situation/ be kind to yourself)

A positive thinker will see the opportunity in every difficulty.”

RPG |  Real Life                   | In Game NPC       | Why 
----|------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------
1   |  Shopping spree               | JudgeMental           | Keep your money
2   |  Youtube while "working"      | Victimizer            | Protect your time
3   |  Incomplete task switching    | ringmaster            | Stay on course
3   |  Giving up when its hard      | neglector       | Be tenacious, persistant
5   |  Online "research" without bound | Protector      | Don't waist working time
6   |  Project without time constraint | TheSiren       | Don't just dream: Do!

## Progression

We track three things:
- Time spent on  Deep work.
- Commitment and consistency.
- Real tangible results

Xp represents the number of *Skcor* completed in a period of 5 days.
The time spent on deep focused tasks is called *Skcor*. A *Skcor* is a chunk or 
block of 20 minutes. Why *Skcor*? Because *Skcor* **rockS**!

Hp tracks your consistency streak. Every 5 days without breaking the chain, 
you add the total of Skcor to the Xp and increment the Hp by 1. You then 
reset the Xp and start tracking *Skcor* for another 5 days.

Optionaly, since Hp are incremented 1 by 1, you can use the space to also note 
the week number (or group of 5 days) and the total *Skcor* for that week. 
This gives use a opportunity to also track the progress of our ability 
to perform deep work.

Lv tracks your accomplishements. Actual non trivial work completed such as projects and 
certifications ... Lv is incremented each time a "real" project with "real" consequences to your life is completed. Impactful stuff such as:

- getting a drivers licence
- publishing a paper
- create and manage an Open Source project
- Completing and online course
...



RPG  |  Real Life                   | to measure
-----|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
Xp   |  Skcor completed per  5 days | Time actually used for meaningful things
Hp   |  Number of "5 days" without  | Current consistency streak
&nbsp;|breaking the chain           |
Lv   |  Number of project completed | Compounded achievements

## Running the game

Everything above could be seen as a productivity tool and story telling engine.
Real life actions are mapped to in game scenes.

The real gaming begins if you add Twists and turns in the unfolding of the story.
That is the story can take different directions without real life input, thus 
altering the dynamics of the game. The real life accompleshements become even more 
crutial, because you need all the points you can get since you never know what
unpredictable mayhem the game can throw at the PIC (Player In Character).

### Binary (ish) questions

Actions in the Scenes can be further enriched with dynamic ingame narratives.
You ask a closed ended question and roll 1D6  and craft the answer.

```
Answer          Do you get what you want?                                   Harm
--------------  ---------------------------------------------------         -----------
Yes, and...     You get what you want, and something else.                  Cause 3
Yes...          You get what you want.                                      Cause 2
Yes, but...     You get what you want, but at a cost.                       Cause 1
No, but...      You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss.     Take 1
No...           You don’t get what you were after.                          Take 2
No, and...      You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.          Take 3
```


### DOUBLES AND THE TWIST COUNTER

If you roll twice the same number consecutively, you get to alter the narrative itself.
  
```
D6          Subject                             Action
1           A 3rd party                         Appears
2           The hero                            Alters the location
3           An encounter                        Helps the hero
4           A physical event                    Hinders the hero
5           An emotional event                  Changers the goal
6           An object                           Ends the scene
```

### DETERMINE THE MOOD OF THE NEXT SCENE

When the next scene is not clear, you can start by setting the mood.

```
D6          Next Scene
1-3         Dramatic Scene
4-5         Quite Scene 
6           Meanwhile
```

###  DISTRACTION and DIRECTION

For skills that are not your forté you can roll and add these modifiers

> Even    Distracted, not in charge   
> Odd     Directed focuced, in charge  

## Tips for writing the story arc

The Kishotenketsu (from qichengzhuanhe), a storytelling structure, can actually correspond to the Dan Harmon Story Circle.

Ki (Introduction):
1. You
2. Need

Sho (Development):
3. Go
4. Search

Ten (Twist):
5. Find
6. Take

Ketsu (Conclusion):
7. Return
8. Change

In a story, the following might happen:

    Introduction (ki): an introduction to the characters, era, and other information required to understand the plot.
    Development (shō): follows leads towards the twist in the story. No major changes so far.
    Twist (ten): the story turns toward an unexpected development. This is the crux of the story, the yama (ヤマ) or climax. If the narrative takes several turns, this is the biggest one.
    Conclusion (ketsu), also called ochi (落ち) or ending, wraps up the story.
