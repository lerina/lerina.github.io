## Build a Mission


Once you have a tentative story outline, it is time to select some real life 
actions, tasks and things to avoid and map it to scenes in our story.
Doing and accomplishing real stuff makes the story go forward.

### 1. Real activities

You make a list of all the tasks you have to do, big or small. 
Don’t filter or organize the items you add to the list, just write it all down 
in a list format.

As stated earlier, there are the 9 Items to take care of for the day.

The PIC (Player in character) and the story progresses scene by scene 
only if your POC (Player Out of Character) progresses in real life by 
completing or performing the 9 specific items for the day.
A real day corresponds to a scene of the character's adventure.

- First you select 3 actions to do for the day.
- Next you select 3 actions **not** to do for the day.
- Finaly you select 3 tasks to complete for the day.


```
renew licence
pay rent
change winter tire

no coffee today
no facebook
no elevators (take the stairs)

read the third chapter of The Rust Programming Language book
do laundry
practice rust code with rustlings
```

### 2. Map activities to Scenes and action play

By maping activities within the game to be in the same spirit as those performed 
by the player in the real life, we get to evolve both the character and the story
as the p[layer actually accomplish real life objectives and targets.

#### Map the story scene to a real life work session or activity

Real life (OC)	    | In the Game (IC)
--------------------|---------------------------
renew licence	    | Get new gear
pay rent	        | Rent a van
appointment to      | meeting with the colonel
change winter tire  |
-                   |-                     
no coffee 	        | succesfully dodge the police
no facebook         | found a spyware tracker
no elevator         | survived a bar fight while trying to upgrade some gears
-   		        | -
read chapter 3 of   | Gather your team
The Rust Programming Language book|
do laundry          | Settled the shares and loot division
practice drills     | Hack into DMV to get new IDs

#### Map story baddees to real life things to avoid

Momentum and consequences regardless of external factors or setbacks.
Progress on growth. 

The big boss of baddees is ... your `inner deceiver`.
The master of self-doubt and self-sabotage.

Subdue the inner deceiver and its five generals


- The JudgeMental
What you did, what you didn't do, what you should have done. The eternal
repetitive negative critic that consumes your internal positivity and replaces it
with out of reach external negativity.
Gets stronger each time you think you are not good enough and lose sight 
of what is within your control.

- The Victimizer
The producer of excuses and drainer of willpower.
Gets stronger each time you give up or stop trying.

- The Misguided Protector
Promotes avoidance by exagerating difficulties to even start.
Fake protection from the risk of failure, judgement or criticism.
Tour "Safe" but Stuck.
Gets stronger each time you are paralized and don't take any action.

- The ringmaster
Productivity guilt. Unhhealthy drive to keep working, pleasing, saying yes.
It is unsustainable and leands to anxiety, crashes, and burnout.
Unfulfilling treadmill of achievement addiction linking your worth as a person 
to how productive you are.
Gets stronger each time you believe you will never be good enough 
or have done enough

- The neglector
Wins then you feel insecure in your worth, anticipate rejection.
Going out of your way to seek approval.
Gets stronger each time you seek validation by prioritizing the needs of everyone else
at your own expense.

The Antidote to deceivers:
Create emotional distance from the deceiver. This make room for more rationality.
This helps shifting into an internal locus of control. How?

Become aware when under attack.

Call it out. Then **choose** not to listen.
write down or go through all the deceivers arguments: 

* Safe and Stuck
    - Is this inside my locus of control? [Y/n]
    - What first step imperfect action can I make *NOW*
* Busy Pleaser
    - Take a break! Is it not what you do but who you are that matters 
    - Are the healthy bounderies up and active?

* Say no
    - Your worth is not linked to how you think other see you.
    - Is your choice an avoidance trap.

Your power:
0. What is is. What was was. acceptance/acknowlegdement of situation as part of life
1. What will be **Restarts** now. You can choose what you focus on at any moment.  selectional attention (focus on things you can change/ on positive things, e.g. name three things you are/were grateful for)
2. You don't make perfection the goal. You make the **process** the goal
3. "is what you are doing helping or harming you?" (control over situation/ be kind to yourself)

A positive thinker will see the opportunity in every difficulty.”
