##  Purpose

The purpose of the game is to create a story where your PC progresses 
only if you complete x amount of real-life challenges.

For instance if the challenge is to completed a set of 9 items 
then will match the completion on these items to a scene from the character's adventure.

- First you select 3 actions to do for the day.
- Next you select 3 actions **not** to do for the day.
- Finaly you select 3 tasks to complete for the day.

These are the 9 Items for the day.

If you choose to write down such generated story,
there is one last but optional work to do. 
Writing down the scene to grow the story.
