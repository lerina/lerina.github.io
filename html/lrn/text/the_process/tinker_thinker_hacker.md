## Tinker - Thinker - Hacker

Training is just like sailing a boat against a river’s flow.   
One would regress if one did not advance.   
Training is particular about persistence.   
In order to become an expert who would be the focus of attention,   
one must naturally put in an effort that others would have difficulty matching.  
_ Lerina ("code alchemy" _ lerina)  

Art is a high calling -- fears are coincidental.   
Coincidental, sneaky and disruptive, we might add,   
disguising themselves variously as laziness, resistance to deadlines, irritation with materials or surroundings, distraction over the achievements of others -- indeed anything that keeps you from giving your work your best shot.  
What separates artists from ex-artists is that those who challenge their fears, continue; those who don't, quit. Each step in the artmaking process puts that issue to the test.”  
― David Bayles, Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking 

### Tinker: Deliberate practice of discovery

| Iterating through GRIT 

"The process of iteration is important to tinkering, and critical to supporting 
thinking and learning while tinkering. 
Exploring a variety of ways to build and refine an idea over time is an important 
part of the process.  
Working on iterations provides an opportunity for learning to deepen, 
and often lead to unexpected new perspectives, and a variety of outcomes.

Ideas and thoughts develop slowly, so do new new questions, observations, 
and experimental outcomes.  
Step-by-step kits, or projects where the outcome is already known (or predictable) 
are less impactful for someone developing a deep understanding of why things work 
the way they do.  
Iteration supports the ability to model the ways that new questions can lead 
to new discoveries. "
