### Tinker: Deliberate practice of discovery

| Iterating through GRIT 

"The process of iteration is important to tinkering, and critical to supporting 
thinking and learning while tinkering. 
Exploring a variety of ways to build and refine an idea over time is an important 
part of the process.  
Working on iterations provides an opportunity for learning to deepen, 
and often lead to unexpected new perspectives, and a variety of outcomes.

Ideas and thoughts develop slowly, so do new new questions, observations, 
and experimental outcomes.  
Step-by-step kits, or projects where the outcome is already known (or predictable) 
are less impactful for someone developing a deep understanding of why things work 
the way they do.  
Iteration supports the ability to model the ways that new questions can lead 
to new discoveries. "
