<h2 id="simple-tcr">SIMPLE TCR</h2>
<p><a href="http://wrigstad.com/ioopm18/simple.html#orgb3285eb">SIMPLE</a> In a nutshell SIMPLE dictates that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the specification in a structured manner to do both function design and data design.</li>
<li>Work in an incremental fashion, by solving many simple problems instead of few complex ones.</li>
<li><strong>Always have a working program</strong> that you can run and test.</li>
<li>Compile continuously.</li>
<li>Test continuously, preferably automated but at least manually.</li>
<li>Write straight-line code first, before complicated branches and loops.</li>
<li>Use tricks – cheating and dodging – to keep programming simple, and push problems into the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi99zbRzkRM">(Test &amp;&amp; Commit ) || Revert</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Always have code in a valid state.<br />
</li>
<li>Write some code, <code>git add .</code></li>
<li>Run your tests.
<ul>
<li>If the tests pass, the code is immediately committed.<br />
</li>
<li>If the tests fails, immediately revert with <code>git reset --hard</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Code must compile and run between each git commit</li>
<li>Test one non-trivial code at a time</li>
<li>commit after each passing test.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outside-in"><a href="https://www.holdenrehg.com/blog/2018-09-22_write-better-code-outside-in">outside-in</a></h3>
<p>Define the entry point for the code.<br />
Assume that any module, function, helper, library, etc. is available, even if the code does not exist.<br />
Write the ideal version of the entry point.<br />
Write the ideal version of any code that was assumed until you start reaching “low level” functions that perform the bulk of the logic.<br />
In other words sketch with one line comments the minimal viable system, and breaks it down into smaller components Repeat until you have all functions defined.</p>
<p>This completes your initial minimal design.</p>
<h3 id="inside-out"><a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Philosophy%20Of%20Test%20Automation.html">inside-out</a></h3>
<p>Now actually implement the logic for the “low level” functions.<br />
Build up functionality one piece at a time. Because your have already done a top-down design with the outside-in aproache, it is now easier to get “really” started, following a methodical approach of identifying the data-structures a function or method will manipulate inorder to perform a certain behaviour.</p>
<p>Coding is a combination of creativity and common engineering practices.<br />
There are thousands of ways to approach a problem and still come up with the same answer. Outside in development is a way to think about software development<br />
from a high level so that we can work through problems efficiently on the fly<br />
while still producing good, readable, testable code.</p>
<p>Outside-in and inside-out terminilogy are often associated with <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Philosophy%20Of%20Test%20Automation.html">TDD</a> since the 90’s but its as actually always been the implicit way coders develope software when you really remove all the hype “du jour”.</p>
