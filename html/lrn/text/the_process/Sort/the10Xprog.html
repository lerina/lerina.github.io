<h1 id="x-is-an-attitude">10X is an attitude</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Try fail correct 10X don’t do things for Fun, Fame, and Fortune.<br />
10X do it for Frequent Feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="short-version">Short version:</h2>
<pre><code>Great programmers break stuff for fun,
build stuff for profit, 
iterate rapidly between the two.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>think(){ code(verify(think())); }</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="long-version">Long version:</h2>
<pre><code>Great programmers iterate quickly.
They learn a lot and practice even more.
They fail often on personal spikes and projects.
They succeed often on payed projects.</code></pre>
<div class="line-block">They mesure consistency. They don’t track lines of code or test coverage.<br />
They mesure frequency. They track the number of iteration complete within a period of time.<br />
They mesure courage. They show up to defy the odds (think a little, code a little, test a little)<br />
They mesure character. They are disciplined when it comes to code</div>
<p>Dive in and learn new codebases with faster ramp up times.<br />
Become great at recognizing patterns. Thats how experts read code.<br />
Become great at debugging code. Thats how hackers trace code. Become great at not wasting Time. Focus, ID problems quickly, think in patterns and concepts.</p>
<p>It ok to be a solo lonecoder. Just hide it by sharing with others.<br />
Recommend the better technical solution in a gentle and open mind way.<br />
Be with code more and more, but take breaks by engaging in people.</p>
