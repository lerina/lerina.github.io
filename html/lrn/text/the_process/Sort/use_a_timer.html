<h1 id="use-a-timer-like-the-equalizer">Use a timer like the <code>equalizer</code></h1>
<p>Forget motivation. Work against the clock. Only rule: Hit the time with consistency or beat your former self.</p>
<p><strong>Alefa</strong>[¹] is productivity technique, that challenges you to get more done in less time. It leverages self-imposed time constraint to make the mundane chores more challenging and difficult tasks less stressing. It releases you from the tyrany of deadlines and the folly of unscheduled work.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select a target</li>
<li>Pick a task or a subset</li>
<li>Give yourself a time period</li>
<li>Zone in</li>
<li>Start the timer and Do!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="select-a-target">Select a target</h3>
<p>Some people keep multiple pool of stuff to do. work todo-list, home todo-list, and self todo-list. Others have agendas full of notes and scheduling. Some people call them goals, other call them projects. In the end it does not matter what style you may have.</p>
<p>It all boils down to having a target composed of <code>Tasks, subtasks &amp; steps</code>.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-task-or-a-subset">Pick a task or a subset</h3>
<p>Breakdown the selected task into smaller steps or components. These steps should be achievable on the same day, within a couple of chunks of 20 min deep work.</p>
<h3 id="give-yourself-a-time-period">Give yourself a time period</h3>
<p>Prepare your work area, or get ready for the task. Decide how long the “work” session will be (20 min at first).</p>
<h3 id="zone-in">Zone in</h3>
<p>Take a deep breath, release slowly as you center yourself. You are now the <code>terminator</code>. relentless. single focus. undistractable.</p>
<h3 id="start-the-timer-and-do">Start the timer and Do!</h3>
<p>Start the timer or stopwatch. Equal or surpass your best time.</p>
<p>The point is not to keep track of the time. The point is to disregard anything that is not the subject of the current time period.</p>
<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Condition yourself to do deep work. 20min of hyperfocus. When you get confortable with 20min of uninterupted work, you can increase the work sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Train yourself to be swift and nimble. Finishing stuff in 20 minutes or less forces you to estimate workload accuratly, and never pick more than you can chew.</p></li>
<li><p>Swift nimble sharp</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="it-works-because">It works because</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It limits your time. Parkinsons law</p></li>
<li><p>Its Efficient No friction. Set the time and Do!</p></li>
<li><p>It Keep you focused. Until the time is up, only one thing matters: Finish what you started before the time is up.</p></li>
<li><p>It tunes off distraction You’ve got to work quickly. Attention to detail becomes paramount. Inattention can cost you … time.</p></li>
<li><p>It kills perfectionism Task completion is the only issue. Speed is of the essence. With freequent feedback, <em>Good enough</em> becomes good enough.</p></li>
<li>It trains the mind to estimate deadlines
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Evaluate What’s Required First, you need to understand exactly what the task involves.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the Right Resources Next, make sure that you have what you need to get the job done promptly.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow for Problems containment. Things don’t always go to plan. Frequent iterations and short 20 min chuncks will minimize the impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Just-in-Time Plannig Keep the big picture at the forefront and only dwelve in the details when it matters</p></li>
<li><p>Deep and Detailed work Break tasks down into small components. Set work sessions only when you are about to perform the task.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It build character. B e like the Equalizer. Here are some ideas to consider:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Be assertive. Learn to say “no,”</li>
<li>Adjust your mindset. Time self-constraint is a fun (and adictive) way to achieve stuff that you might otherwise put off.</li>
<li>Don’t mistake “planning” for “doing.” Planning is just a road map. You still need to hit the road to get from A to B.</li>
<li>Make good use of your time. You’ll NEVER get it back. Why give it away for free?</li>
<li>Beat self-sabotaging behaviors. Procrastination is not the problem: It is the consequence. Addressing this is simple; Just start the timer.</li>
<li>Forget motivation. Just stay in sync with your time estimate or beat the clock.</li>
<li>Make meeting your estimates a habit. Start by working toward smaller steps in your daily work. Expend as your grow comfortable.</li>
</ul>
