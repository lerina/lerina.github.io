# Use a timer

Using a timer to increase productivity works 
because it supports focusing long enough to get difficult or unpleasant tasks done.
The simple idea is to set the timer for a short amount of time that you need 
to focus on a particular task, and get to it.  
While the timer is counting down, no checking email or surfing the web.  
No chats with colleagues or answering the phone. Focus only on the task.


5 Ways Setting A Timer Increases Productivity

## 1 | You Work With More Focus

Setting a timer for 20 minutes will help you tune out distractions, 
because you know you need to focus in order to complete your task 
before time runs out. 
You also know exactly what you need to accomplish 
during that time frame, so you won’t waste time trying to multi-task.

> Focus time

## 2 | You Turn Work Into A Game

I’m all about games. 
And tricking myself with self-imposed deadlines works surprisingly well! 
If I have a task that seems daunting or that I really don’t want to do, 
I turn on the timer and challenge myself to beat the clock. 
I’ve found this works really well with yard work. 
The giant tree in front of our house drops mounds of leaves to rake up every fall. 
Although raking leaves isn’t all that fun, I challenge myself to see how fast I can rake 
a section of the lawn. 

> Playing “beat the clock” can be very motivating!

## 3 | You Work Faster

Tasks expand to fill the time (Parkinsons law). 
If you don’t have a time limit, you can probably spend hours “working” on something. 
For example, if I decide I’m going to spend Saturday morning cleaning the house, 
I will wander from room to room “cleaning” all morning long. 
But when lunchtime rolls around, the house will still need more cleaning. 
This is a totally different story if I’m expecting company to arrive at 11:00. 
With a deadline, I will work much faster and be far less distracted. 
I’ll get more cleaning done in less time. 
Remind yourself that tasks expand to fill the time you give to them. 
Giving yourself less time will motivate you to work faster and resist distractions.

> limit your time to perform

## 4 | You See The Finish Line

If you’re dragging your feet to do a chore, set a timer and get started. 
You can do anything for 10 minutes, right? I often do this when washing dishes. 
I don’t want to do the dishes, but I can surely handle 10 minutes! 
I set the timer on the stove and get started. When the timer beeps, I get to stop. 
If there are still dishes left, I’ll come back later and work on them for 10 more minutes. 
When you give yourself a short block of time to work on something, 
it helps you focus on the task at hand and helps you see the finish line. 
That’s a great motivator for getting started, especially if it’s a task you are dreading.

> Stick until the time is up


## 5 | You Make Progress On Huge Projects

If you have a big project on your to-do list with a far-off deadline, 
it’s really easy to keep putting it off until tomorrow. 
It doesn’t seem urgent, and there’s no way you have time to work on it today, right? 
Many writers use a timer to motivate them to finish chapters of their books. 
A huge project, like writing a book, can seem daunting. 
Projects like this are often so big that we feel paralyzed to even start. 
But choosing one small piece of that project to work on today 
and setting your timer is a great way to push yourself to dig in and get to work. 

If you break that project up into smaller tasks with mini deadlines or time limits, 
you’ll slowly chip away at it. It will help you make progress on the project without 
getting absorbed in it for the entire day. 

> When your time runs out, it’s time to take a break and move on to the next thing.

---

Setting a timer helps to stay on task and knock out everything on a single task to-do list. 
That is ONE task broken into multiple steps.

Giving yourself a time limit helps you focus and finish a task before 
it’s time to move onto the next thing in the day.

Select a task. 
    Write down why. "I do this task in order to ..."
Decompose the task into steps. 
    Write down what. "a then b then c"
Choose a sacrifice. 
    Write down your won'ts. "I will not surf the web, yt, ..."
Elect a step, 
    give yourself a time to beat.
Start chrono and get to work!
