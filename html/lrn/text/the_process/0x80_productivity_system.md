## Productivity
To bridge the gap between intention and action, some people like to t hinking 
of their work in terms of war. I prefer to see it as a live action, a performance.

### The system is called 0x80
0x80 is a alias for `do what was previously defined`.
The system hold in 3 points.
- Perfom the process
- until time is up
- without distraction

In other words when you do something specific, you are *on air* , *in session*, *live*  

Have a [SQUID GAME ▲●■](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game) mindset: Code as if your life depended on it.

▲ Without Distraction  
● Perform the Process  
■ While in Session  

### 4 rules
In order to accomplish 0x80 it is assumed one wants to do what was previously defined .
Hence some rules apply

1. It is wise to Acquire a Target First. (Be specific about your intent)  
It is unwise to just embark on a nebulous task
2. It is wise to set a timeframe.  
It is unwise to just do without a deadline
3. It is wise to guard your Actions from Distractions.  
It is unwise to give in to instant self-gratification
4. It is wise to seek feedback.  
It is unwise to take it personally.

### ODY: Remedy to 

[] `O`bstacle cleared
[] `D`istractions to avoid identified
[] `Y`ield to the *process*

### TMP: Create a temporary focus bubble

Until the time is up, *shift*  into session mode and "observe the doing"

#### Temporal (Do the time: Stick to it)

- Protect your Time
- Limit your Time
- Use your Time

#### Mental (Be water: Egoless nothing can stick to it)

- Let go of Feelings
- Let go of Desires
- Let go of Doubt

#### Physical (Stick-out: Fail it til you make it)

- Deliberate speed (Slow down)
- Deliberate Actions (Attend to the intent)
- Deliberate Posture (Decorium)

## Tinker - Thinker - Hacker

### Tinker: Deliberate practice of discovery

| Iterating through GRIT 

"The process of iteration is important to tinkering, and critical to supporting 
thinking and learning while tinkering. 
Exploring a variety of ways to build and refine an idea over time is an important 
part of the process.  
Working on iterations provides an opportunity for learning to deepen, 
and often lead to unexpected new perspectives, and a variety of outcomes.

Ideas and thoughts develop slowly, so do new new questions, observations, 
and experimental outcomes.  
Step-by-step kits, or projects where the outcome is already known (or predictable) 
are less impactful for someone developing a deep understanding of why things work 
the way they do.  
Iteration supports the ability to model the ways that new questions can lead 
to new discoveries. "
