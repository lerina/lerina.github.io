<p>I’ve been trying to explore what “loops” <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPecMsFmEm4"
target="_blank">software writers</a> actually go though both internally
and externally while developing or implementing a solution to a POC
(Problem, Opportunity, Challenge).</p>
<p>We are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"

<p>What rituals and set of practices do programmers use when alone and
ready to pick a problem to solve? I had the good fortune of stumbling
upon <a href="http://wrigstad.com/ioopm18/simple.html">SIMPLE: A
Programming Methodology</a> by Tobias Wrigstad, a Professor in Computing
Science at <a href="http://www.uu.se/" target="_blank">Uppsala

<p>This text is a re-interpretation of those ideas consolidated under
three guiding principles and three precepts.</p>

Waves are actually energy passing through the water, causing it to move in a circular motion.
Though waves do cause the surface water to move, the idea that waves are travelling bodies of water is misleading.
The water in waves doesn’t travel much at all. The only thing waves do transmit across the sea is energy.

Wave height: the distance between the crest and the trough.
Wavelength: the distance between two identical points on successive waves, for example crest to crest, or trough to trough.
Still water level: where the water surface would be if there were no waves present and the sea was completely calm.

source: https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/waves.html

Period: the time it takes for two successive crests to pass a given point.
Frequency: the number of waves passing a point in a given amount of time, usually expressed as waves per second. This is the inverse of the period.
Speed: how fast the wave travels, or the distance traveled per unit of time. This is also called `celerity` (c), where

c = wavelength  x  frequency

Therefore, the longer the wavelength, the faster the wave.

 that celerity is responsible for increases and decreases in stream discharge (the hydrograph), while velocity controls how old is the water reaching the stream at a given time.

-->
<p>The point is to be as Still as possible. The shorter wavelength and
the smaller the wave height the flatter and managable our activity will
be. The apparent Cerelity hit due to short wavelength is offset though
sustainable high frequency.</p>
<p>hurdles you will require a good understanding of the algorithms and
techniques you intend to implement.</p>

<h2 id="running-example-the-simple-warehouse">2 Running Example: The
Simple Warehouse</h2>
<p><a href="#TOC"> <code>^--</code> </a></p>
<p>The simple warehouse program is an information system for managing
the contents of a storage facility for different kinds of wares.<br />
Every ware in the warehouse has a name, a description, a storage
location, a pricetag, information about the number of items of the
particular ware stored in the warehouse, and the cost of each
item.<br />
A storage location is a “section” (a single letter a-z), plus a shelf
(an integer).</p>
<p>The simple warehouse program manages a database of wares and supports
the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code>dding a ware</li>
<li><code>R</code>emoving a ware</li>
<li><code>E</code>diting the information about a ware</li>
<li><code>P</code>rinting the information for a specific ware</li>
<li><code>L</code>isting all wares in the database</li>
<li><code>U</code>ndoing the last action</li>
<li><code>Q</code>uitting the program</li>
</ul>
<p>When starting the program, the user is presented with the main menu
with the above alternatives and picks a choice by entering the first
letter of each alternative, i.e., |<code>A</code>|, |<code>R</code>|,
|<code>E</code>|, |<code>P</code>|, |<code>L</code>|, |<code>U</code>|,
or |<code>Q</code>|.</p>
<p>When choosing to quit, the user is prompted with a yes/no question:
do you really want to quit? If the answer is |Y|, the program exits. If
the answer is |N|, the program displays the main menu again. If the
answer is anything other than |Y| or |N|, an error message is printed
and the question repeated.</p>
<p>When choosing to add a ware, the user is prompted with five
consecutive dialogues asking her to enter the required information for a
ware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Storage location</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Amount</li>
</ul>
<p>The program then displays the information back to the user and asks
whether this is correct or not. The user has three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the information</li>
<li>Save the information</li>
<li>Abort</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice is again indicated by entering the first character of each
option. The first alternative allows the user to re-enter one piece of
the required information for a ware after which the editer ware is
displayed again with the same question as above. The save alternative
saves the information to the database and then returns to the main menu.
The abort alternative returns to the main menu without saving.</p>
<p>The rest of the actions on the main menu should be fairly
self-explanatory.</p>
