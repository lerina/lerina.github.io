<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>To bridge the gap between intention and action, some people like to t hinking of their work in terms of war. I prefer to see it as a live action, a performance.</p>
<h3 id="the-system-is-called-0x80">The system is called 0x80</h3>
<p>0x80 is a alias for <code>do what was previously defined</code>. The system hold in 3 points. - Perfom the process - until time is up - without distraction</p>
<p>In other words when you do something specific, you are <em>on air</em> , <em>in session</em>, <em>live</em></p>
<p>Have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game">SQUID GAME ▲●■</a> mindset: Code as if your life depended on it.</p>
<p>▲ Without Distraction<br />
● Perform the Process<br />
■ While in Session</p>
<h3 id="rules">4 rules</h3>
<p>In order to accomplish 0x80 it is assumed one wants to do what was previously defined . Hence some rules apply</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is wise to Acquire a Target First. (Be specific about your intent)<br />
It is unwise to just embark on a nebulous task</li>
<li>It is wise to set a timeframe.<br />
It is unwise to just do without a deadline</li>
<li>It is wise to guard your Actions from Distractions.<br />
It is unwise to give in to instant self-gratification</li>
<li>It is wise to seek feedback.<br />
It is unwise to take it personally.</li>

<div class="line-block">Iterating through GRIT</div>
<p>"The process of iteration is important to tinkering, and critical to supporting thinking and learning while tinkering. Exploring a variety of ways to build and refine an idea over time is an important part of the process.<br />
Working on iterations provides an opportunity for learning to deepen, and often lead to unexpected new perspectives, and a variety of outcomes.</p>
<p>Ideas and thoughts develop slowly, so do new new questions, observations, and experimental outcomes.<br />
Step-by-step kits, or projects where the outcome is already known (or predictable) are less impactful for someone developing a deep understanding of why things work the way they do.<br />
Iteration supports the ability to model the ways that new questions can lead to new discoveries. " _ <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/tinkering/blog/2016/06/19/the-art-of-iteration">The art of Iteration</a></p>
