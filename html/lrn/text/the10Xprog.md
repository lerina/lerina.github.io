# 10X is an attitude
> Try fail correct
10X don't do things for Fun, Fame, and Fortune.  
10X do it for Frequent Feedback.  

## Short version:
    
    Great programmers break stuff for fun,
    build stuff for profit, 
    iterate rapidly between the two.

## Long version:
    
    Great programmers iterate quickly.
    They learn a lot and practice even more.
    They fail often on personal spikes and projects.
    They succeed often on payed projects.

| They mesure consistency. They don't track lines of code or test coverage. 
| They mesure frequency. They track the number of iteration complete within a period of time.
| They mesure courage. They show up to defy the odds (think a little, code a little, test a little) 
| They mesure character. They are disciplined when it comes to code 

Dive in and learn new codebases with faster ramp up times.  
Become great at recognizing patterns.  Thats how experts read code.  
Become great at debugging code.  Thats how hackers trace code.
Become great at not wasting Time. Focus, ID problems quickly, think in patterns and concepts.  

It ok to be a solo lonecoder. Just hide it by sharing with others.  
Recommend the better technical solution in a gentle and open mind way.  
Be with code more and more, but take breaks by engaging in people.   

## The 10X super power is applied energy on what matters

- Monotask. Is this the topic of my session? Yes/No
- Cultivate Energy . Energy > Time management.
- Disconnect from the Net. Set Net as a work session if you need it.
