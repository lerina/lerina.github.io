# acronym driven development
:-)

## Uphold the S.E.C.T.

TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels.
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to stand by the SECT:

`S`tory Driven        Requirements  
`E`xample Driven      Design  
`C`ode Driven         Development  
`T`est Driven         Delivery  

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code that matter.

PS:  
I promise not to write books or make seminars about it.
It's safe to try and bonus it actually works! 

## FOCUS when you code

`F`eedback friendly  
`O`rganised  and prepared  
`C`ommited  to the task  
`U`nswayed by distraction   
`S`ingle tasking  

## FEEDback Driven
|↴  
|  `F`raction the Problem to 'f'etch a solution  
|  `E`xperiment then 'e'liminate lesser solution(s)                  
|  `E`ncode and 'e'valuate  the candidate solution(s)          
|  `D`etect anomalies

## SIMPLE TCR

[SIMPLE](http://wrigstad.com/ioopm18/simple.html#orgb3285eb)
In a nutshell SIMPLE dictates that you:

- Use the specification in a structured manner to do both function design and data design.
- Work in an incremental fashion, by solving many simple problems instead of few complex ones.
- **Always have a working program** that you can run and test.
- Compile continuously.
- Test continuously, preferably automated but at least manually.
- Write straight-line code first, before complicated branches and loops.
- Use tricks – cheating and dodging – to keep programming simple, and push problems into the future.

[(Test && Commit ) || Revert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi99zbRzkRM)

- Always have code in a valid state.  
- Write some code, `git add .`
- Run your tests.  
    * If the tests pass, the code is immediately committed.  
    * If the tests fails, immediately revert with `git reset --hard`.  

---

- Code must compile and run between each git commit
- Test one non-trivial code at a time
- commit after each passing test.

## Productivity
To bridge the gap between intention and action, some people like to t hinking 
of their work in terms of war. I prefer to see it as a live action, a performance.

### The system is called 0x80
0x80 is a alias for `do what was previously defined`.
The system hold in 3 points.
- Perfom the process
- until time is up
- without distraction

In other words when you do something specific, you are *on air* , *in session*, *live*  

Have a [SQUID GAME ▲●■](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game) mindset: Code as if your life depended on it.

▲ Without Distraction  
● Perform the Process  
■ While in Session  

### 4 rules
In order to accomplish 0x80 it is assumed one wants to do what was previously defined .
Hence some rules apply

1. It is wise to Acquire a Target First. (Be specific about your intent)  
It is unwise to just embark on a nebulous task
2. It is wise to set a timeframe.  
It is unwise to just do without a deadline
3. It is wise to guard your Actions from Distractions.  
It is unwise to give in to instant self-gratification
4. It is wise to seek feedback.  
It is unwise to take it personally.

### ODY: Remedy to 

[] `O`bstacle cleared
[] `D`istractions to avoid identified
[] `Y`ield to the *process*

### TMP: Create a temporary focus bubble

Until the time is up, *shift*  into session mode and "observe the doing"

#### Temporal
- Protect your Time
- Limit your Time
- Use your Time

#### Mental
- Let go of Feelings
- Let go of Desires
- Let go of Doubt

#### Physical
- Slow down
- Deliberate Actions
- Posture and Decorium
## Tinker - Thinker - Hacker

### The deliberate practice of discovery

_"
The process of iteration is important to tinkering, and critical to supporting thinking and learning while tinkering. Exploring a variety of ways to build and refine an idea over time is an important part of the process. Working on iterations provides an opportunity for learning to deepen, and often lead to unexpected new perspectives, and a variety of outcomes.

Ideas and thoughts develop slowly, so do new new questions, observations, and experimental outcomes. Step-by-step kits, or projects where the outcome is already known (or predictable) are less impactful for someone developing a deep understanding of why things work the way they do. Iteration supports the ability to model the ways that new questions can lead to new discoveries.
