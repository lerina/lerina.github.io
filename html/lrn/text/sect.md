## Uphold the S.E.C.T.

TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels.
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to stand by the SECT:

`S`tory Driven        Requirements  
`E`xample Driven      Design  
`C`ode Driven         Development  
`T`est Driven         Delivery  

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code that matter.

PS:  
I promise not to write books or make seminars about it.
It's safe to try and bonus it actually works! 

## FOCUS when you code

`F`eedback friendly  
`O`rganised  
`C`ommited  
`U`ndistractable  
`S`ingle tasking  

## FEEDback Driven

## SIMPLE TCR

[SIMPLE](http://wrigstad.com/ioopm18/simple.html#orgb3285eb)
In a nutshell SIMPLE dictates that you:

- Use the specification in a structured manner to do both function design and data design.
- Work in an incremental fashion, by solving many simple problems instead of few complex ones.
- **Always have a working program** that you can run and test.
- Compile continuously.
- Test continuously, preferably automated but at least manually.
- Write straight-line code first, before complicated branches and loops.
- Use tricks – cheating and dodging – to keep programming simple, and push problems into the future.

[(Test && Commit ) || Revert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi99zbRzkRM)

- Always have code in a valid state.  
- Write some code, `git add .`
- Run your tests.  
    * If the tests pass, the code is immediately committed.  
    * If the tests fails, immediately revert with `git reset --hard`.  

## Productivity
To bridge the gap between intention and action, some people like to t hinking 
of their work in terms of war. I prefer to see it as a live action, a performance.

### The system is called 0x80
0x80 is a alias for `do what was previously defined`.
The system hold in 3 points.
- Perfom the process
- until time is up
- without distraction

In other words when you do something specific, you are *on air* , *in session*, *live*  

Have a [SQUID GAME ▲●■](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game) mindset: Code as if your life depended on it.

▲ Without Distraction  
● Perform the Process  
■ While in Session  

### 4 rules
In order to accomplish 0x80 it is assumed one wants to do what was previously defined .
Hence some rules apply

1. It is wise to Acquire a Target First. (Be specific about your intent)  
It is unwise to just embark on a nebulous task
2. It is wise to set a timeframe.  
It is unwise to just do without a deadline
3. It is wise to guard your Actions from Distractions.  
It is unwise to give in to instant self-gratification
4. It is wise to seek feedback.  
It is unwise to take it personally.
