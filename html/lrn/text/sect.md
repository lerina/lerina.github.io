# acronym driven development
:-)

## Uphold the S.E.C.T.

TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels.
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to stand by the SECT:

`S`tory Driven        Requirements  
`E`xample Driven      Design  
`C`ode Driven         Development  
`T`est Driven         Delivery  

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code that matter.

PS:  
I promise not to write books or make seminars about it.
It's safe to try and bonus it actually works! 

## FOCUS when you code

`F`eedback friendly  
`O`rganised  and prepared  
`C`ommited  to the task  
`U`nswayed by distraction   
`S`ingle tasking  

## FEEDback Driven
|↴  
|  `F`raction the Problem to 'f'etch a solution  
|  `E`xperiment then 'e'liminate lesser solution(s)                  
|  `E`ncode and 'e'valuate  the candidate solution(s)          
|  `D`etect anomalies
