# Use a timer like the `equalizer`

Forget motivation. Work against the clock. 
Only rule: Hit the time with consistency or beat your former self.

**Alefa**[¹] is productivity technique, that challenges you 
to get more done in less time.
It leverages self-imposed time constraint
to make the mundane chores more challenging
and difficult tasks less stressing.
It releases you from the tyrany of deadlines and the folly of unscheduled work.


## How it works
- Select a target 
- Pick a task or a subset
- Give yourself a time period
- Zone in
- Start the timer and Do!

### Select a target
Some people keep multiple pool of stuff to do. 
work todo-list, home todo-list, and self todo-list.
Others have agendas full of notes and scheduling.
Some people call them goals, other call them projects.
In the end it does not matter what style you may have.

It all boils down to having a target composed of `Tasks, subtasks & steps`.


### Pick a task or a subset
Breakdown the selected task into smaller steps or components.
These steps should be achievable on the same day,
within a couple of chunks of 20 min deep work.

### Give yourself a time period
Prepare your work area, or get ready for the task.
Decide how long the "work" session will be (20 min at first).

### Zone in
Take a deep breath, release slowly as you center yourself.
You are now the `terminator`. relentless. single focus. undistractable.

### Start the timer and Do!
Start the timer or stopwatch. 
Equal or surpass your best time. 

The point is not to keep track of the time.
The point is to disregard anything 
that is not the subject of the current time period.

## The point
- Condition yourself to do deep work. 20min of hyperfocus. When you get confortable with 
20min of uninterupted work, you can increase the work sessions.

- Train yourself to be swift and nimble. Finishing stuff in 20 minutes or less
forces you to estimate workload accuratly, and never pick more than you can chew.

- Swift nimble sharp

## It works because

1. It limits your time.
Parkinsons law

2. Its Efficient
No friction. Set the time and Do!

3. It Keep you focused.
Until the time is up, only one thing matters: 
Finish what you started before the time is up.

4. It tunes off distraction
You've got to work quickly.
Attention to detail becomes paramount. 
Inattention can cost you ... time.

5. It kills perfectionism
Task completion is the only issue. 
Speed is of the essence.
With freequent feedback, *Good enough* becomes good enough.

6. It trains the mind to estimate deadlines
    1. Evaluate What's Required
        First, you need to understand exactly what the task involves.

    2. Get the Right Resources
        Next, make sure that you have what you need to get the job done promptly.
        
    3. Allow for Problems containment.
        Things don't always go to plan. Frequent iterations and short 20 min chuncks
        will minimize the impact. 
        
    4. Just-in-Time Plannig
        Keep the big picture at the forefront and 
        only dwelve in the details when it matters

    5.  Deep and Detailed work
        Break tasks down into small components. 
        Set work sessions only when you are about to perform the task.
        

7. It build character. B e like the Equalizer.
Here are some ideas to consider:

- Be assertive. Learn to say "no,"
- Adjust your mindset. Time self-constraint is a fun (and adictive) way to achieve stuff that you might otherwise put off.
- Don't mistake "planning" for "doing." Planning is just a road map. You still need to hit the road to get from A to B.
- Make good use of your time. You'll NEVER get it back. Why give it away for free? 
- Beat self-sabotaging behaviors. Procrastination is not the problem: It is the consequence. Addressing this is simple; Just start the timer.
- Forget motivation. Just stay in sync with your time estimate or beat the clock. 
- Make meeting your estimates a habit. Start by working toward smaller steps in your daily work. Expend as your grow comfortable.

The Equalizer
    
    "Progress, not perfection."
    ―Robert McCall

    "Gotta be who you are in this world, right? No matter what."
    ―Robert McCall

    "Doubt kills."
    ―Robert McCall

    "I think you can be anything you wanna be."
    ―Robert McCall

    "Change your world."
    ―Robert McCall

    "... do something about it because you can."
    ―Robert McCall

    "I don't have a lot of time. Which means you don't have any."
    ―Robert McCall

    "Sometimes the answer's right in front of you."
    ―Robert McCall

The Equalizer 2
    
    "There are two kinds of pain in this world. Pain that hurts. Pain that alters."
    ―Robert McCall

    "This is the point where usually I'd, uh, give you a chance to do the right thing, but not tonight."
    ―Robert McCall

    "..., "supposed to do" and "will do" are two different things, ..."
    ―Robert McCall

    "You're right. I guess anybody could do it, but nobody does, ...  
     Ends up with everybody complaining because nobody did  
     what anybody could've done or should've done to begin with."
    ―Robert McCall

Laser Focus

0. Be stress free, destress. Try meditation.
1. Prioritize tasks, create priority list, score each task and should add up to 100.
2. Allocate 80% time on long term gains and 20% on short term. Take breaks for short term stuff.
3. Create Not-ToDo list EVERY DAY.
4. Tasks that are directly fun are more easier to focus; job vs video game.
5. Set time limit for work session, it keeps you on toes and motivated.
