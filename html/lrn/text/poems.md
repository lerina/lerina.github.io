we all bring our contribution

Urging to depart,
my taking for granted ...
The blissfull feeling;

friend, accomplice, wife
in our journey of life.

Life's road map.

Riding the wave of time,
Destination nowhere.
Feel the relentless tide,
Pulling deeper into the sea.

However great, `tradition` is not static.
For culture is just a circumstential expression
