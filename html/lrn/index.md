## Hi,

I'm Lerina, a software developer based in Waterloo ON, Canada<br/> but you can sometimes find me in Paris (France) or Antananarivo (Madagascar).

I currently only take work involving Rust and/or webassembly (wasm).  
These projects usualy happen within the context of a partial update or maintenance of some Python, Javascript/Ts, or C codebase .

There are a lot of projects out there that are useful and deserve to ascend to the next level.

This leveling-up often focus on Safer libraries, Faster modules, Leaner dependencies.

Oxidize: Why 

Replace sensible modules with Rust and/or wasm drop-in replacements. 

 significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.


Rust is a systems language that provides memory safety without garbage collection, and concurrency without race conditions

Handpicked open source projects I've worked on.

## Parity

We’re looking for a senior software developer with proven Rust experience, working knowledge of Substrate, and general familiarity with blockchain technologies. In this position, you must understand decentralized, high-performance systems, analyze and optimize the platform’s performance, be able to run tests in a distributed environment, and have experience with security audits of third-party and internal solutions. You must also be interested in the Polkadot ecosystem, and design, research and develop blockchain-based solutions. As an ideal candidate, you have proven experience coding, developing, and testing software programs, preferably using the Rust programming language. 


## Preferred qualifications
Experience with blockchain technology 
Experience in Rust programming


## Sample interview questions
Can you explain Rust?   
What are the advantages of using Rust?  
How does Rust’s garbage collection work?  
How do you get a command line argument in Rust?  
What are some main features of Rust?  
Does Rust include move constructors?  
How would you write and run a Rust program?  
What string type would you use with Rust?  
Why is Rust a safer option compared to C and C++?  
How do you use Rust’s reusable codes?  
How would you efficiently input a user read file in Rust?  
Rust syntax is similar to which programming language?  
Can you list the platforms supported by Rust?  
How do you install Rust?  
How do you uninstall Rust?  
What is Cargo?  
How do you debug Rust programs?  
Can Rust be used for Android/iOS programming?  
How do you do dynamic Rust library loading?  

## Crazy _goal_ > Smart _goal's_ 

We've all heard of SMART the an acronym used for creating Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-based goals. It doesn't say anything about execution.

CRAZY goal is the next step. 

> `C` ontrained in time and space  [At the correct place, within the right time]
> `R` elevant and robust           [meaningful and worth your total commitment]
> `A` ccountable process actions   [chunks are either done or not. No excuses.]
> `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!    [Top-down design, bottom-up implementation: Beat your best time.]
> `Y` ield early, reap frequently  [feedback loop]

Notice its GOAL, not goals. Pick one goal and make sure its CRAZY.

### `C` ontrained in time and space  
Schedule the _lifeline_. Number of time-bubbles to work on it.

### `R` elevant and robust
(non-frivoulus and impactful)

### `A` ccountable process actions 
top-down view, bottom-up execution

### `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!  
see the context, the why, the big picture
Dive into the task, one sub-task at a time

### `Y` ield early, reap frequently  
Measure progress by keeping count of the time-bubbles dedicated to the process of sub-task completion.

Keep in mind that 
Progress is a process:  
While one Plans progress with goals, one Makes progress with processes.
