## Crazy _goal_ > Smart _goal's_ 

We've all heard of SMART the an acronym used for creating Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-based goals. It doesn't say anything about execution.

CRAZY goal is the next step. 

> `C` ontrained in time and space  
> `R` elevant, recoverable  
> `A` ccountable process actions  
> `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!  
> `Y` ield early, reap frequently  

Notice its GOAL, not goals. Pick one goal and make sure its CRAZY.

## `C` ontrained in time and space  
Schedule the _lifeline_. Number of time-bubbles to work on it.

## `R` elevant, resiliant  
(non-frivoulus and impactful)

## `A` ccountable process actions 
top-down view, bottom-up execution

## `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!  
see the context, the why, the big picture
Dive into the task, one sub-task at a time

## `Y` ield early, reap frequently  
Measure progress by keeping count of the time-bubbles dedicated to the process of sub-task completion.

Keep in mind that 
Progress is a process:  
While one Plans progress with goals, one Makes progress with processes.


## Hello. I'm a software writer.

That's right! writer.

More akin to writers of the film industry than the book market.  
Writing code has technical constraints and people cooperation considerations.

*- As a code author*,  
I don't write code to make computers do things. That's the job of our programs.  
I write code to be shared, maintaned and efficiently accomplish a mission.  
I write solutions to challenges, opportunities and problems that have first  
been modelled and solved to yield three imperatives:

-   clear output
-   defensive input
-   explicit nomenclature

Talking of writing, I also dabble in [poetry](./text/poems.html){.link
.black-50} and have occasional things to say about the [Software
development journey](./code/index.html){.link .black-50}.
