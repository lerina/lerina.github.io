## I'm a software writer.

That's right! writer.

More akin to writers of the film industry than the book market.  
Writing code has technical constraints and people cooperation considerations.

*- As a code author*,  
I don't write code to make computers do things. That's the job of our programs.  
I write code to be shared, maintaned and efficiently accomplish a mission.  
I write solutions to challenges, opportunities and problems that have first  
been modelled and solved to yield three imperatives:

-   clear output
-   defensive input
-   explicit nomenclature

Talking of writing, I also dabble in [poetry](./text/poems.html){.link
.black-50} and have occasional things to say about the [Software
development journey](./code/index.html){.link .black-50}.
