Rust is a systems language that provides memory safety without garbage collection, and concurrency without race conditions

Handpicked open source projects I've worked on.

## Hi,

I'm Lerina, a software developer based in Waterloo ON, Canada but you can sometimes find me in Paris (France) or Antananarivo (Madagascar).

I currently work (as a preference) primarily in Rust.

producing consistent and reliable code and ensuring a safe and secure operating environment with the systems and software they create. Additionally, they’ll need to be able to debug, test, and analyze current and previous iterations of software to resolve issues.

 experience with languages like C++, Node.js., React, and more. Possessing great attention to detail and strong analytical skills will set a candidate apart.


🚀 I consistently clear obstacles. If something is broken or lacking, I dive in to investigate, file a thorough ticket, and most of the time fix or implement the feature myself (see example issue and PR), and if what I need doesn’t exist yet, I will build it.

🐞 I love the thrill of the chase of debugging. This has led me to diagnose and address subtle and elusive bugs in all manner of previously-unfamiliar, complex, and diverse projects (see below), and all have been tremendous learning opportunities.

⚡ My thrill for debugging has allowed me to develop an acute ability to dive deep into unfamiliar projects and quickly make meaningful contributions (see below).

## Position trends
The Rust programming language is relatively new, yet it is becoming one of the hottest programming languages. Top Rust developers are working on Rustacean Principles in order to keep Rust moving forward as the best method to do safe, fast, and easy software development. The principles will function as robust guides to Rust’s long-term development. 

Because Rust is considered better and safer than C and C++, the future for Rust looks bright. It’s fast and universal, and you can use it to build a wide variety of applications for different platforms. Rust stands out compared to other increasingly popular languages such as Ruby and Python, another reason its star is expected to continue to rise. 

There appears to be no end to how Rust can be adopted as it is being considered in various challenging environments, including Linux drivers and the Android project with the aim of improving security.

## Crazy _goal_ > Smart _goal's_ 

We've all heard of SMART the an acronym used for creating Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-based goals. It doesn't say anything about execution.

CRAZY goal is the next step. 

> `C` ontrained in time and space  [At the correct place, within the right time]
> `R` elevant and robust           [meaningful and worth your total commitment]
> `A` ccountable process actions   [chunks are either done or not. No excuses.]
> `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!    [Top-down design, bottom-up implementation: Beat your best time.]
> `Y` ield early, reap frequently  [feedback loop]

Notice its GOAL, not goals. Pick one goal and make sure its CRAZY.

### `C` ontrained in time and space  
Schedule the _lifeline_. Number of time-bubbles to work on it.

### `R` elevant and robust
(non-frivoulus and impactful)

### `A` ccountable process actions 
top-down view, bottom-up execution

### `Z` oom out, zoom in: Zap it!  
see the context, the why, the big picture
Dive into the task, one sub-task at a time

### `Y` ield early, reap frequently  
Measure progress by keeping count of the time-bubbles dedicated to the process of sub-task completion.

Keep in mind that 
Progress is a process:  
While one Plans progress with goals, one Makes progress with processes.
