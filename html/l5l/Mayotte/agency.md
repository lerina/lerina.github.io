How Much Does It Cost to Create a High-Quality Website in 2024?

- The most cost-effective option will be to design your website yourself, with expenses varying from $100 to $3,000 or beyond.
- For a basic custom website design produced by an agency, the cost may be anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000.
- For more extensive and complex websites, the cost may range from $40,000 to $75,000 or more.

###     Website Size. 

There is a considerable cost difference between building a large website and a small one. The cost of web development services will be reflected in what you pay for an e-commerce website with 500 pages. Alternatively, you can build a simple website for a fraction of that price by using a standard template and only a few pages.

```
Type of website 	                        Estimated design cost
Small business website (8 to 16 pages) 	    $2,000 to $9,000
Large business website (25 to 75 pages) 	$10,000 to $35,000
E-commerce website (100 to 1,000 products) 	$5,000 to $55,000
Database website (20 to 2,000 pages) 	    $6,000 to $75,000
```

How Much Does Web Design Cost?

Web design service costs anywhere between $1,000 and $100,000. You’re probably looking at this price range and wondering why there’s such a big discrepancy, so let’s break it down:
Up to $1,000

This type of website doesn’t require much. Maybe a landing page, an about us page, and a basic services menu totaling around five pages. A basic website option suits companies that conduct most of their business offline, but need an online presence for local SEO purposes.
Up to $5,000

Rather than point to an offline business, an eCommerce website functions as an extension of a business or as the entire business itself. An eCommerce business website will usually integrate an order management system, delivery tracking, and live chat features.
Over $10,000

Obviously, the more customized a website is, the greater its development costs. Larger eCommerce businesses tend to need more data-focused integrations. With this comes ongoing maintenance and iteration development.

Furthermore, the higher a website costs, the greater ROI. Let’s take Amazon, for example. The retail giant has a gigantic inventory and ships to multiple locations. You can imagine the sheer size and amount of data management required.

Moreover, the eCommerce giant gathers a substantial volume of customer data. Its advanced analytics means the company has greater insights into customer behavior and can better target buyers with relevant products that appeal to their needs and aspirations.

Can you see how the data a large company gathers potentially saves and makes millions over the long term?

Comrade’s web solutions start a $10,000 for simpler projects and increase as customization becomes more complex; we don’t follow a cookie-cutter approach. Built into our development cost is the time it takes to ideate, execute and test your website.

Our team will first assess your goals and requirements, which they outline in a Specifications Document to guide the structure of your budget and our KPIs.

For complex projects, we take a T&M (time and material) approach. This is when clients agree to pay us based on the time we spend doing the work and materials used, regardless of how much work is required to complete their business website.

### website designer

The cost of using a website designer: £4,000 – £60,000+ upfront

#### Why should I find a web designer?

Designing, or redesigning, a website requires a great deal of time and work, which is why using a third-party expert can prove more efficient (if also more expensive).

Working with a web designer has lots of benefits. They can:

- Help with SEO
- Manage your website – and fix any bugs – long term
- Offer more design experience
- Provide access to extra resources
- Save you time


### Web design agencies

Web design agencies typically charge you on an hourly basis. Chameleon Studios, a Cambridge-based marketing agency, gave us insight on a rough price list for web design depending on what type of agency you use:

- Offshore company – £10-25 per hour
- Freelance web designer – £25-£50 per hour
- Small web agency – £50-£75 per hour
- Large web agency – £75-£150 per hour

Based on insights from a number of developers, we’re going to accept that an average small business website takes around 12 weeks to build. We’ll also assume the agency is devoting seven hours a day to your project. That means you’re looking at a total price of £4,200 – £63,000 for the development of your business website.

Of course, there are a lot of hypotheticals here, and a number of variables we haven’t factored into our estimates – namely, the size and complexity of the website you’re trying to build. The more pages and functionality your website has, the longer it will take and the more it will cost.

There are also some running costs you’ll need to factor into your website budget. These include:

## Why choose a web design company?

Web design companies are typically creative or specialist developer agencies that work to deliver projects to different clients.

You should use a design company if you want a quicker turnaround time and better communication.

Design companies also typically work closely with branding and marketing teams, which means you’ll get support with aesthetics and SEO as well as web functionality.

Because of benefits like these, a design company will usually be more expensive than a freelancer – so it won’t always be the best option for SMEs.

But a web design company will not only create your website – it will also help manage it long term.

As a result, we recommend this option to small firms with high-maintenance website needs, such as those requiring an ecommerce or content hosting site.

## Why choose a freelance web designer?

A freelance web designer is a self-employed designer – not an organisation – who works for clients.

The difficulty with choosing a freelancer to design your site over an agency is that freelancers typically have fewer resources to ensure they can stay on top of deadlines.

But a good freelancer is usually more customisable than an agency and more open to new ideas, as you only need to discuss your idea with one person. Freelancers are also typically cheaper than web design agencies.

For these reasons, you should use a freelancer if your website is an aspect of your business, but not your main source of income – if you run a high street cafe or shop, for example.

## Example portfolio

You wouldn’t hire a portrait artist without first wanting to see their work – and finding a web designer is similar.

Experience, culture, and portfolio matter. You’ll want to analyze these carefully before deciding.

When searching for the best design company or freelancer for your site, make sure you get a proper, detailed look at their previous work – it can usually be found on their website.

Why is this important?

If your website is going to be effective, it needs to look great and perform brilliantly. It should also be unique to your business, so take care that the company you’re considering isn’t trying to palm you off with a templated design that’s used by countless other businesses.

It’s a good idea to have a look around the web to find sites that you like the look of, are easily navigable, and that you feel are effective in their market.

Usually, the designer will be credited on the site. If not, you could get in contact with the business itself and ask them who’s behind their build – which brings us to our next point…


Ideally, you’ll want an agency that has experience in designing websites in your industry. They should also have sufficient web designer and UX experience.

Determine if the websites they’ve created for previous clients are clear. Are they intuitive and user-friendly? Do they explain how they resolved their clients’ pain points?

Hint: Not having case studies is a definitive red flag!

## website cost in the UK?

If you ask us for our honest opinion, the cost of having a website designed can be anywhere between £500 – £10,000+.

Wow! That’s a pretty big gulf in prices we hear you say! And you’d be right – and that’s exactly why there is such mass confusion around the cost of website design projects in the UK.

So, how come that range of prices can be so vast?
It’s all because you need much more specific information to be able to accurately cost a web design project.

On the lower end of the spectrum (around the £500 mark) you have the costs associated with using a website builder and doing it all yourself, and on the higher end of that spectrum (£10k+) you have a complex e-commerce website that has many bespoke requirements.

<aside> Hopefully, you can now start to see how simply asking “how much does a website cost” is much too vague – there is so much more information that needs to be gathered to establish an accurate cost.</aside>

### bespoke websites.

When we say “bespoke” we’re talking about websites designed from the ground up, with every aspect carefully considered and crafted from a blank canvas.

That means the design and user experience can be exactly as you need it to be to accomplish your business goals, and it’ll likely be that there are elements of custom functionality you require too; like a booking system, customer portal or members area to name but a few possibilities.

For bespoke websites, you could be looking at costs of anywhere from £3,000 – £10,000, depending on the size of the site in question and the functionality requirements.

Let’s look at how the price of the same website project can vary if you approached a freelancer, a small studio and a large web design agency.

```
                            Bespoke Small Website 	Bespoke Large Website
Freelancer 	                £1,000 – £2,500 	    £3,000 – £4,500
Small studio (2-10 staff) 	£3,000 – £5,000 	    £5,000 – £10,000
Agency (10+ staff) 	        £8,000 – £10,000 	    £15,000+
```

## Upfront payment

In the web design industry it’s not unusual to make an upfront payment in order to get your project underway.

Don’t be put off by this, it’s the norm.

Because a web project requires a large amount of upfront effort to get started, web designers will need reassurance that you are serious about the project and the upfront payment allows them to secure the time for your project in their schedule.

As a general rule most web design companies do a 25% or 33% payment upfront, and then break down the remaining payments over the course of the project.

Sometimes you might be asked to do a 50% upfront payment, but if your total project cost is over £3,000 we’d recommend you try and negotiate this down.
