`Software Development` happens way before any line of code is hatched.
Whether one is a software engineer, a web developer or an old school hacker the core principles remains the same;

- Clarity and Understanding through openness and adventure.
- Creativity in Coding      through concise explicitness and structure. 
- Agency by Delivery        through swiftness and collaborative infrastructure. 




**Agency by Delivery**

Agency is about POWER

P. Purpose      &    Principles  
O. Organization &    Opportunity  
W. Willingness  &    Wit  
E. Efficiency   &    Execution   
R. Resolve      &    Resources   

As a technical solution emerges, 

Tell me about your **P.A.I.N.** <span id="PAIN"></span>

- **P**roject or **P**roblem (to solve) <a href="./#Pain"> more ...</a>
- **A**genda/Ambition or **A**ngst/Anger (to fix) <a href="./#pAin"> more ...</a>
- **I**nspiration or **I**rritation  (to heal) <a href="./#paIn"> more ...</a>
- **N**iche and **N**eeds (to get started) <a href="./#paiN"> more ...</a>

Don't butcher your way through your IT Project. Everybody can write code. 
But not everybody can write good code.
Like wise anybody can talk about design, but not everybody can actually 
deliver a good design. Talent is where creativity and practice meet repetitively. 
Very often in the IT world, design Talents and coding Talents need to meets 
repetitively 

## Tell me about your P.A.I.N.

If you are a content writer, designer or entrepreneur you've got `P.A.I.N.` 
and that is great. 
You want to get thing out in the world. Perhaps we may work together, 
until that <img src="./logo_lerina_16x16.png" align="bottom" /> `l`ast `R`elease.


## Some Code

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut days_left: u8 = 10;
     
    println!("{} days to startup!", days_left);
}
```

I enjoy working with others to produce a better outcome.
I try to find the best fitting technology for a given problem. 
While my professional background is mostly Python, 
thanks to Webassembly I have reconnected
with JavaScript and fallen in love with Rust.
