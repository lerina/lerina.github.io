## `S`tory Driven Requirements  
ABC of Decomposition  
`A`quire:      Context. Question the Subject of your Attention (subject matter).
`B`reakdown:   See the blueprint, patterns, parts.
`C`hunkify:    Make coherant chunks, steps, modules.
`D`igest:      internalize possible creative building blocks, or discard.

## `E`xample Driven Design  
SPIKE  
`S`hort
`P`ractical
`I`investigative
`K`nowledge (Kleenex)
`E`xperiments

## `C`ode Driven Development  
CODE  
`C`omponent
`O`rchestration
`D`etailed
`E`xplicitly

How?

### lerina design recipe  
`L`. LIST     Examples, Key demo usage.      (docstring, usage with results)
`E`. EXPRESS  Expected Types.                (1st line Type contract)
`R`. REVEAL   Header signature.              (def name parameters)
`I`. INSERT   Informative Description.       (purpose, help text)
`N`. Nest Comment outline and NURTURE  Body. (Neat and Nimble code)
`A`. ATTEST   Demo usage passes.             (run doctest/unit test)

#### Nurture Neat and Nimble code  

Capture the intent of an action  
- Pseudocode should describe    the what 
- Comments should describe      the why
- Code should describe          the how 

dual-nature:
    placeholder for the how (code)
    prelude to the why (comment)

Sketching with Pseudocode:

    FIRST PASS  -> Comment section
    Second Pass -> Comment or delete
    third pass  -> Placeholder for code
