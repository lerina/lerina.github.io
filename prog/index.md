-    The Challenge. This defines "where we are now" and is always either a problem or an opportunity.
-    The Undesired Outcome. This defines "where we don't want to be"--what will happen if the problem or opportunity is not addressed.
-    The Desired Outcome. This defines "where we do want to be," which should obviously be better than the undesired outcome.
-    The Proposed Solution. This defines what must be done to avoid the undesired outcome and achieve the desired one.
-    The Risk Remover. Why the proposed solution is likely to succeed and unlikely to fail.
-    The Call to Action. The decision you want made that will put the solution into motion to achieve the desired outcome.
