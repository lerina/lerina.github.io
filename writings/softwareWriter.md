Mr Smith (Matrix) is right. We are software writers, code writers.
Git blame returns the code author
we are Digital Code Author

But we are more akin to writers of the film industry than the book market. 
We have technical constraints and people cooperation imperatives.

- As code authors, we don't type commands into a computer to make it do things. 
That's the job of our programs.

We write solutions to challenges, opportunities and problems we've modelled 
and solved. 

We only code problem solving software, once we've decoded a satisfactory 
solution.

To neophytes we appear to code algorithms and orchestrate their interactions 
to process input data and spit out a desired output. Its only half of the story.

In reality, we write code and commit messages that reads as a story of the system 
it. How clear and concise our intent is made for other programmers to read through
is the halmark of a valuable software writer.
The narrative either implicite or explicit or both, helps all of us implements 
and better produce software that matters.
