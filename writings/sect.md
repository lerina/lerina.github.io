TDD, BDD, the noise has reached cult-like levels. 
So here is my contribution, when you code, I urge you to stand by the SECT:

- `S` tory Driven Requirements
- `E` xample Driven Design
- `C` ode Driven Development
- `T` est Driven Delivery

And by all mean, push for 100% test coverage, of those portions of code 
that matter.
