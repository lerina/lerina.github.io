# CLEAR Choice

Concrete, Lean, Efficient, Accessible, Resolute CHOICE.

The way of Harmony or the way of Armory?
It is our pretention that civilized people strive
to spare those around them the affliction of 
embarassement and discomfort.

The Refined being strives to make everyone comfortable.
The Brute relish in short term emotional rushes 
derived from illusions of power exercises on people at
the expense of group harmony.

The choice is c.l.e.a.r;
To Strive to act like a civilized being
or aggress, harrass, and disgrace all rules of civility 
in the name of freedom and force of character.

A Cyclone is powerful, formidable and imposing. 
It also bring destruction, pain and sorrow.

A gentle breeze is discrete, smooth and soothing. 
It brings seeds of growth, energy and cooling calmness.

To impose oneself by force, with total disregard for others is easy and dumb.
To impose oneself as a result of popular demand is harder but wise.

Influence through force is limited in time:
The period of one's apparent invincibility is up the moment 
the next fool commanding even more strength appears in the picture.
How quick the masses flock to this stronger brute

Influence through affluence is a lifetime venture.
It creates lasting relationships, build social capital and 
strengthen harmony.

When has any choice been so clear?

## WoA: The Practice

```
Needs are few, yet wants are many.
Cravings are raging, but will is stronger.
To act and not to be acted upon,
thus is the way of the Practitioner.

Accept, deflect the fruits of life.
Seize the real through self-improvement.
Tame the unreal through self-control.
thus is the way of the Practitioner.

Repel, dispel rogue expectations.
Nurture focus, discipline, and wisdom.
Where frustration arises, feed it not
thus is the way of the Practitioner.

Henceforth assert that in all matters:
The lens of perception do not alter understanding.
The filter of emotions do not impoverish thought.
Thus is forged the Sword of Wisdom.

Words do not turn into hateful speech.
Action do not lead to harmful deeds.
Livelihood does not cause pain and destruction.
Thus is sharpened the Art of Discipline

Effort is oblivious to desire or ambition.
Mindful awareness does not stumble and falter.
Centered the Now concentrates in the Present.
Thus is polished the power of Focus.

In harmony, within the flow
like a raft in the eye of the storm,
 we are stable yet not static.
thus is the way of the Practitioner.

Unfettered by change or setbacks
Undeterred by fear or ridicule
we blend-forth resilient and resolute.
thus is the way of the Practitioner.

Be it a time of might or flight.
Sow the seeds if this legacy.
Apply it in all things great or trite.
thus is the way of the Practitioner.
